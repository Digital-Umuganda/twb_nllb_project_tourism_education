While also concerned with our ability to restore function after a shock, some people argue that resilience needs to focus on flexibility and adaptability, supporting systems to take on new forms without crossing a threshold or collapsing. In this case, resilience is concerned with the degree of change a system can absorb while maintaining system functions. \n",

In order to build resilience, both aspects need to be taken into account. Buildings have to be adapted to future risks such as increased rain falls due to climate change and people have to learn how to react to a crisis situation. \n",

With government restrictions and social distancing in place, the business model of many hotels was not viable anymore, thus a return to business-as usual was not possible. Instead, hotels innovated, for example by providing their space for quarantine and self-isolation, accommodation for health service professionals or long-term accommodation for workers.\n",

      "text:  You have reached the end of the Artificial Intelligence for Policy Makers course! \n",
      "text:  We hope that this course has deepened your understanding of how public policy may support the responsible adoption of AI. \n",
      "text:  The course can be summarised into the following modules:\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  In Module 1 we saw that AI is quite old as a concept, and has been implemented using both human and data-derived algorithms. \n",
      "text:  The rapid growth of AI has been driven by advances in computing hardware, availability of data and machine-learning knowledge. \n",
      "text:  However, the increasing adoption of AI seems to be having an unequal impact on societies, with the potential for harm, and so we need to explore more responsible approaches to AI adoption.\n",
      "text:  In Module 2 we explored how public policy may support responsible development and adoption of AI. \n",
      "text:  We discussed key foundations and enablers of AI policy, from increasing the availability of representative data sets to supporting public sector use.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Module 2 also covered specific sectors and domains affected by AI. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Identity and biometrics is of particular importance given its cross-cutting impact, and there are several ways of mitigating possible harms related to increased data and AI use, such as introducing data minimisation or sensitive data handling regulations.\n",
      "text:  In Module 3 the focus was on governance as an enabler of responsible AI, starting with an analysis of different types of AI-related harms, from individual to structural, and governance approaches for managing these harms, from risk-based to rights-based. \n",
      "text:  We also explored the governance of data, to better understand how data may be classified and shared in support of AI-based applications.\n",
      "text:  In Module 4 we worked through more practical aspects of AI policy making, by looking at how developers are attempting to build more trustworthy AI systems, and by highlighting how policy and public interest safeguards can be introduced as part of the AI implementation lifecycle. \n",
      "text:  In the second part of Module 4, you were introduced to social impact assessment (SIA) as a specific tool that can be used to map out the benefits and harms of AI implementation at individual, collective and structural levels.\n",
      "text:  Finally, in Module 5, our attention was directed towards institutionalising AI policy making. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  The first part of the module discussed government AI readiness and how this may be assessed, and highlighted AI procurement as a specific issue. \n",
      "text:  The second part was a broader discussion of the AI ecosystem: what roles different sectors or stakeholders may play, different types of institutional arrangements, and what processes may be followed for developing AI policy.\n",
      "text:  Well done on completing this course on Artificial Intelligence for Policy Makers!\n",
      "text:  We encourage you to complete both the short quiz after this module and the final quiz in atingi. \n",
      "text:  A course certificate will automatically be generated should you achieve a pass mark of 70% or greater in the final quiz - good luck!\n",

      "text:  No, that's a bad idea. You need to know ahead of time.  One way a business can measure its success is by calculating its profit or loss.\n",

      "text:  Income or revenue is the total amount of money a business has generated over a set period of time — e.g. one month or one year.\n",
      "text:  Expenses are the amounts of money spent to generate that revenue — on things like equipment, electricity, advertising and wages.\n",
      "text:  Calculating profit/loss is easy, it’s just Income minus Expenses.\n",

      "text:  A variable expense is a cost that occurs regularly but the cost varies from month to month. Examples include electricity, groceries, gas, etc.\n",

      "text:  Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) historically covered a spatial distribution of up to nine million km, from the Iranian coast throughout the Indian sub-continent and well into China. Wild Asian elephant populations are now extinct in West Asia, Java and China with the exception of the southern Yunnan Province, bordering Laos and Myanmar. \n",
      "text:  As mentioned in the video you watched, wild Asian elephant populations currently exist in 13 Asian and Southeast Asian nations: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. The three subspecies of Elephas maximus; E. m. indicus; E. m. maximus and E. m. sumatranus are found on mainland Asia, Sri Lanka and Sumatra respectively. Sadly, Asian elephants are considered an endangered species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. \n",

      "text:  Wild elephant populations face many uncontrollable, human-caused threats. While of course wild elephant populations are essential, at this point in time, their habitat and range is shrinking.\n",
      "text:   Wild elephants can’t be considered safe or secure in any southeast Asian country. Some of the key threatening process facing wild elephant populations are shown below. The benefits of a captive population is that all of these threatening processes can be managed, monitored and controlled.\n",
      "text:  Asian elephants are found in regions of the world that also have growing human populations. Various pressures are placed on the natural environment, including land clearing for agriculture, plantations, and concessions. These may encroach into protected areas as well. \n",
      "text:  Fragmentation squeezes wild elephant populations into smaller and smaller pockets of habitat. These can be considered islands in a hostile environment. Elephants are then unable to find enough food, a suitable mate, and human-elephant conflict can occur when elephants attempt to relocate. Wild elephant populations begin to decline.  \n",
      "text:  Where both elephants and humans share space, conflict occurs. This is usually in direct response to land clearing for agricultural use or infrastructure such as damns, mines or settlements. Even roads can cause stress and conflict. \n",
      "text:  Poaching a is major risk for Asian elephants, with skin and other body parts as much in demand as ivory. Wild elephant can be caught in snares designed for other species as well. \n",
      "text:  As you can see, there is an interrelationship between all the factors that currently threaten wild elephant populations. Many NGOs and conservation groups attempt to mitigate the impacts of these threats, including various ways to avoid human-elephant conflict. Some projects have success but elephant populations are still decreasing across their range.  \n",
      "text:  There are considerable variations in the estimates of the total number of remaining wild Asian elephants. The IUCN SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group (2019) estimate the wild Asian elephant population to be between 30,000 to 50,000 individuals.

      "text:  Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) historically covered a spatial distribution of up to nine million km, from the Iranian coast throughout the Indian sub-continent and well into China. Wild Asian elephant populations are now extinct in West Asia, Java and China with the exception of the southern Yunnan Province, bordering Laos and Myanmar. \n",
      "text:  As mentioned in the video you watched, wild Asian elephant populations currently exist in 13 Asian and Southeast Asian nations: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. The three subspecies of Elephas maximus; E. m. indicus; E. m. maximus and E. m. sumatranus are found on mainland Asia, Sri Lanka and Sumatra respectively. Sadly, Asian elephants are considered an endangered species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. \n",

      "text:  Wild elephant populations face many uncontrollable, human-caused threats. While of course wild elephant populations are essential, at this point in time, their habitat and range is shrinking.\n",
      "text:   Wild elephants can’t be considered safe or secure in any southeast Asian country. Some of the key threatening process facing wild elephant populations are shown below. The benefits of a captive population is that all of these threatening processes can be managed, monitored and controlled.\n",
      "text:  Asian elephants are found in regions of the world that also have growing human populations. Various pressures are placed on the natural environment, including land clearing for agriculture, plantations, and concessions. These may encroach into protected areas as well. \n",
      "text:  Fragmentation squeezes wild elephant populations into smaller and smaller pockets of habitat. These can be considered islands in a hostile environment. Elephants are then unable to find enough food, a suitable mate, and human-elephant conflict can occur when elephants attempt to relocate. Wild elephant populations begin to decline.  \n",
      "text:  Where both elephants and humans share space, conflict occurs. This is usually in direct response to land clearing for agricultural use or infrastructure such as damns, mines or settlements. Even roads can cause stress and conflict. \n",
      "text:  Poaching a is major risk for Asian elephants, with skin and other body parts as much in demand as ivory. Wild elephant can be caught in snares designed for other species as well. \n",
      "text:  As you can see, there is an interrelationship between all the factors that currently threaten wild elephant populations. Many NGOs and conservation groups attempt to mitigate the impacts of these threats, including various ways to avoid human-elephant conflict. Some projects have success but elephant populations are still decreasing across their range.  \n",
      "text:  There are considerable variations in the estimates of the total number of remaining wild Asian elephants. The IUCN SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group (2019) estimate the wild Asian elephant population to be between 30,000 to 50,000 individuals.

      "text:  Captive Asian Elephants\n",
      "text:  One of the biggest arguments against elephant-based tourism is that elephants shouldn’t belong in captivity at all. Let’s explore this deeper; see how we got to this point in time, and why a captive elephant population, which includes elephant-based tourism, is now important.\n",
      "text:  Culture and religion\n",
      "text:  Captive Asian elephants play a constant, intrinsic role in southeast Asian culture and national identity. Elephants remain an auspicious symbol in the region’s prominent animist and Buddhist beliefs. Receiving prestige and status by national royalty for their usefulness in warfare, captive elephants were equally as important to rural communities for village construction, goods transportation and logging.  Elephants are considered so intertwined with humanity that they are the only species other than humans that Baci ceremonies and blessings are performed for; an ancient tradition calling our souls back into our bodies. This ceremony is still commonplace in many parts of Southeast Asia. \n",
      "text:  Elephants play an incredibly important role in both Hinduism and Buddhism, with Erawan, the three-headed holy elephant, a symbol of greatness and wisdom. Erawan featured on the former Lao PDR flag, and is still a prominent figure at temples throughout Southeast Asia.  \n",
      "text:  From a Western perspective, it can be difficult to understand and appreciate the relationship between elephants, religion and culture. Christianity is a monotheist religion, with followers worshiping a singular God. Religions or belief systems such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Animism worship many versions of God (polytheism).\n",
      "text:  The following short clip shows footage from the Lao Elephant Festival, 2007, a nation once named Lang Xang, the Land of a Million Elephants. \n",
      "text:  Colliding cultures\n",
      "text:  Elephant ownership is commonplace throughout Southeast Asia, but volatile, emotive and diverging attitudes surround the issue of modern-day elephant ownership. Much has been written about how our cultural background affects our environmental values. Values are the internal framework that each of us base decisions on, such as whether something is good or bad, important or not. Values tend to be similar among cultural or other groups of people, such as socio-economic status. Unconsciously, our values can form ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ norms and expectations, without appreciating alternative contexts such as socio-economic, cultural and geographical differences.\n",
      "text:  People and cultures may hold either intrinsic or instrumental values towards animal utilization. People with intrinsic values typically believe that animals should not be used for human gain. This view is held by many western animal rights groups. Whereas people holding instrumental values view animal utilization as a normal part of human existence and indeed form part of our  survival.\n",
      "text:  Western conservation groups have historically viewed elephant ownership as inhumane and fundamentally cruel, whereas attitudes are entirely different in nations where elephant ownership is normal.\n",
      "text:  Western conservation groups – traditionally the main funders of elephant conservation – have focussed funding efforts on wild elephant populations, including projects such as habitat retention, human-elephant conflict mitigation and eradicating poaching. As a result, the protection and conservation of the captive Asian elephant population has never been afforded the same awareness or global interest as wild elephant management. The difference in Western values and attitudes surrounding captive elephant ownership has caused deep divides and we will explore this matter in detail soon. \n",
      "text:  Within each range nation despite, or perhaps because of tradition, the existence of captive elephants and their persistence into the future has been taken for granted. Ownership of captive elephants and policy affecting elephant ownership varies significantly. For example, captive elephants in the Lao PDR are mainly owned by individuals or private business, whereas in Indonesia captive elephants are owned by the State but licensed to particular venues under strict regulation.\n",
      "text:  Elephants were historically captured from the wild for human use. As a wild animal, it was necessary to train captured elephants into compliance, similar to how Australian settlers and stockmen used to ‘break in’ wild brumbies.\n",
      "text:  The capture of elephants from the wild is now illegal in every range nation, except under exceptional circumstance.\n",
      "text:  For example, Sumatran elephants are sometimes trapped in snares by illegal poachers. The individual elephant may be too maimed to be able to be successfully rereleased back into the wild, and will have to live at a government-run conservation camp with other injured elephants.\n",
      "text:  While some capture from the wild may occur in countries like Burma, it is harder and harder to traffic live elephants. It is also not necessary, as elephants are breeding in captivity.\n",
      "text:  Capture from the wild is not the only major change that has occurred for captive elephants over the past 20-30 years. Other changes (and improvements) include:\n",
      "text:  A generation (or more) of elephants have now been born into captivity. They are not wild, not domesticated but in between, and are very used to being around humans.\n",
      "text:  Improved national laws and regulations surrounding captive elephant registration and proof of ownership. This aims to prevent registration loopholes and the illegal capture of calves from the wild. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  There have been other improvements made to elephant policy and legislation, for example the ban on street elephants in Thailand.\n",
      "text:  The importance of scientific research and evidence has been recognised by academic institutions. Money and science are now being invested into captive elephant care and management. \n",
      "text:  Scientific breakthroughs and evidence-based research regarding captive elephant management, diet, stress and hormone levels, disease control, and environment enrichment are now available. \n",
      "text:  See studies done by the Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute for examples of their latest captive Asian elephant research and publications.\n",
      "text:   The development and implementation of both the Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare and the Five Domains of Animal Welfare; implemented by zoos, sanctuaries and other venues globally. Broadly, the five freedoms must guarantee:\n",
      "text:   Please see the RSPCA for further information.\n",
      "text:  Improved positive training and target training techniques at elephant venues. This allows captive elephants to receive training without fear or violence.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Organisations such as the Human-Elephant Learning Project (H-ELP) offer excellent captive elephant training techniques.\n",
      "text:  Let's quickly watch a captive elephant training session performed by staff from the Human-Elephant Learning Project (H-ELP). This will give you an indication of just how physically and psychologically gentle captive elephant training sessions are.   \n",
      "text:  We will touch of some of these points in more detail later, as they are really important issues that continue to impact the sector. \n",
      "text:  Despite the reduction in wild elephant capture and the strengthening of laws to protect elephants, images of elephants being tortured or mistreated remain fresh in people’s minds. This has hindered the international acceptance of the human-elephant relationship in Southeast Asia. \n",
      "text:  Nevertheless, the rapid decline in wild elephant populations has highlighted the recent significance of the captive elephant population. But Southeast Asia does not currently have a practical, cohesive or unified captive Asian elephant management strategy.\n",
      "text:  Expert recommendations\n",
      "text:  The Asian Elephant Range States Meeting (2017) calls for better captive elephant management and viewing the captive elephant population as an important tool for the conservation of the wild elephant population. Representatives from the IUCN SSC recommend that there is a need to adapt a long-term approach to captive elephant management, including:\n",

      "text:  Some Asian elephant experts do not entirely agree with breeding of captive Asian elephants. This is a perfectly understandable opinion; countries such as Thailand have plenty of captive elephants.\n",
      "text:  Captive breeding should not be considered on a laissez-faire approach but should follow national and international endangered species plans and recommendations.\n",
      "text:  What is right for one country may not be right for another. It is important that issues such as captive breeding are viewed on a case-by-case basis, rather than making broad simplifications of this complex issue.\n",

      "text:  Ecotourism features highly in the promotion of Southeast Asia as a tourism destination. Southeast Asian ecotourism focuses heavily on nature-based activities such as remote village trekking, bike riding, water sports, caving and elephant-based tourism. A diverse ecotourism sector can bring community, economic and visitor resilience to Southeast Asian nations. \n",
      "text:  The elephant-based tourism industry has grown considerably in the past 20-30 years.  Most of this growth has been ad-hoc in nature. Many elephants in tourism are aging, ex-logging elephants once captured from the wild. With logging elephants not needed anymore, these elephants are now working in tourist camps. \n",
      "text:  Elephant-based tourism can be defined as any tourism activity where wild or captive elephants are a key part of the visitor experience. Typical elephant-based tourism activities include elephant riding, trekking, viewing or feeding.\n",
      "text:  Elephant venues are often classified as being either anthropocentric or ecocentric in management, with the difference in management styles causing major conflict between animal rights groups, elephant professionals and tourism stakeholders. \n",
      "text:  People or organisations that are classed as anthropocentric tend to focus on the world through human values. These people or places can still be interested in conservation, but the principle reasons are for the value and importance that the environment brings to people. \n",
      "text:  Being an anthropocentric elephant venue does not necessarily mean the venue does not take care of its elephants.\n",
      "text:  Instead, it may mean that their marketing highlights the benefits that elephant tourism brings to the wider community. \n",
      "text:  This may include advertising how the venue provide villagers with better jobs and livelihoods; the money they give to their local village fund; or the donations of supplies they present to local schools.\n",
      "text:  They are demonstrating the human benefits that the elephant venue provides. \n",
      "text:  Alternatively, people with ecocentric values believe that nature has an intrinsic worth and should not be linked with what benefit it can bring us. Camps marketing from an ecocentric position prefer to define themselves as refuges or safe-havens for retired or ex-logging elephants. In reality, camp management and the back-of-house may run in a very similar fashion to each other.  \n",
      "text:  We will cover what to look for in marketing greenwashing further on in the course. \n",
      "text:  Current challenges in elephant-based tourism\n",
      "text:  Elephant-based tourism is a consistent highlight and ‘must see’ visitor experiences when coming to Southeast Asia. But there is a perfect storm brewing between conflicting approaches, opinions about 'ethical' elephant tourism,  issues with the elephant population itself and accusations of animal cruelty. \n",
      "text:  Major issues with elephant-based tourism include:\n",
      "text:  Thousands of elephants have been born into captivity, but this has mainly occurred in Thailand where they have younger cows. Traditionally, there was a push away from captive breeding at tourism camps in other range nations. \n",
      "text:  There are several reasons for this and is mainly to do with the financial upkeep of keeping a calf. Calves have previously been viewed as a financial burden on elephant venues. They have ongoing expenses with food and supervision, while the mother cannot undertake riding or other tourism activities while she is tending to her calf for several years. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Elephant camp owners have stated that tourists will happily visit their camp without a calf onsite, so did not consider it was worth the time or effort to reproduce. Aging cows are also generally nulliparous and physically unable to reproduce. Issues can also arise between camp managers and rented elephants regarding calf ownership and financial compensation. \n",
      "text:  As mentioned earlier, there has been a prolonged and aggressive campaign against elephant ownership for many years. This has occurred from (mainly) Western organisations and associations that have different values and attitudes surrounding Asian elephants. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Many Western organisations view breeding elephants into captivity as intrinsically wrong. These groups cite a lack of environmental enrichment, poor welfare and the elephants’ ‘right’ to live in the wild. Even touching an elephant is considered inappropriate by many of these organisations.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  With a lot of donor money backing these international media campaigns, it is incredibly difficult for local communities and their voices to be heard, understood and included in the discourse.\n",
      "text:  There are undoubtably a lot of poor performers in elephant-based tourism. But in the last 20 years the sector has delivered strong reform and improvements in the way of captive elephant microchipping, greater registration to counteract illegal smuggling and the introduction of DNA passports. Despite these improvements, the sector is still plagued with a poor reputation that it is still trying to shake off. \n",
      "text:  Tour operators understand that elephant-based tourism is a massive drawcard and has the potential to be a significant income generator for their business. But public pressure means some international destination management companies are choosing not to engage (or at least advertise) in elephant tourism. Tour operators have been desperate for national guidance and support for this sector. They seek clear leadership and support from national tourism authorities.\n",
      "text:  Captive elephant management has historically been an under-researched area. Thankfully, research is now being done regarding captive elephant physiology, hormone and stress levels, training, riding, disease control and other areas of captive elephant management.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  This information is published and shared within the academic and elephant realms, but rarely seems to make an impact or change behaviours within tourism policy or animal rights groups.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  There are many peer-reviewed papers now indicating that elephant-based tourism does not have to be detrimental to an elephants’ health, safety or wellbeing. \n",
      "text:  Poor built infrastructure has been identified as a barrier to improving and increasing tourism in remote areas of Southeast Asia. Poor roads, low-quality accommodation and untrained staff at elephant camps have been flagged by some tourism operators as to why they are hesitant to send clients to areas outside of major tourism hubs.\n",
      "text:  Many of the points we have already covered, such as elephant training, smuggling and welfare, relate to animal cruelty. As this is such a critical issue for the industry to overcome, let’s explore it in more detail. \n",
      "text:  Animal cruelty\n",
      "text:  The elephant-based tourism sector continues to be plagued with claims of animal cruelty. Footage of elephants performing unnatural tricks continues to go viral and does nothing to improve sector credibility or build trust between elephant venues, tour operators and tourists. Many tourists and international non-government organisations believe elephants are being exploited and forced to perform cruel tricks for tourist dollars. \n",
      "text:  Please watch the following clip for an example of footage from Thailand in 2016. Videos such as this make the elephant-based tourism industry difficult for tour operators and tourists to openly support. \n",
      "text:  It doesn’t really matter what country these images are taken, or the how old the images are, many people are outraged by elephants suffering for tourism purposes and assume this practice is standard across the sector. In reality, animal cruelty is not indicative of the entire industry. Despite this, the result of these images on the tourism industry are: \n",
      "text:  Tour operators are under enormous pressure not to sell tickets to elephant venues. This has led to the blanket banning and boycotting of all elephant venues by some international tour operators and online travel booking sites.\n",

      "text:  Social license can be defined as the level of acceptance or approval that stakeholders and communities extend to a project, site, company or industry. While technically an entirely legal sector of the tourism industry, elephant-based tourism is struggling to find its acceptability as an appropriate tourism product. Ad-hoc approaches to the industry, a lack of regulation and continual issues with alleged animal cruelty means this sector currently fails to gain support and traction in some visitor demographics.\n",

      "text:  Ecotourism and elephants\n",
      "text:  Ecotourism features highly in the promotion of Southeast Asia as a tourism destination. Southeast Asian ecotourism focuses heavily on nature-based activities such as remote village trekking, bike riding, water sports, caving and elephant-based tourism. A diverse ecotourism sector can bring community, economic and visitor resilience to Southeast Asian nations. \n",
      "text:  The elephant-based tourism industry has grown considerably in the past 20-30 years.  Most of this growth has been ad-hoc in nature. Many elephants in tourism are aging, ex-logging elephants once captured from the wild. With logging elephants not needed anymore, these elephants are now working in tourist camps. \n",
      "text:  Elephant-based tourism can be defined as any tourism activity where wild or captive elephants are a key part of the visitor experience. Typical elephant-based tourism activities include elephant riding, trekking, viewing or feeding.\n",
      "text:  Elephant venues are often classified as being either anthropocentric or ecocentric in management, with the difference in management styles causing major conflict between animal rights groups, elephant professionals and tourism stakeholders. \n",
      "text:  People or organisations that are classed as anthropocentric tend to focus on the world through human values. These people or places can still be interested in conservation, but the principle reasons are for the value and importance that the environment brings to people. \n",
      "text:  Being an anthropocentric elephant venue does not necessarily mean the venue does not take care of its elephants.\n",
      "text:  Instead, it may mean that their marketing highlights the benefits that elephant tourism brings to the wider community. \n",
      "text:  This may include advertising how the venue provide villagers with better jobs and livelihoods; the money they give to their local village fund; or the donations of supplies they present to local schools.\n",
      "text:  They are demonstrating the human benefits that the elephant venue provides. \n",
      "text:  Alternatively, people with ecocentric values believe that nature has an intrinsic worth and should not be linked with what benefit it can bring us. Camps marketing from an ecocentric position prefer to define themselves as refuges or safe-havens for retired or ex-logging elephants. In reality, camp management and the back-of-house may run in a very similar fashion to each other.  \n",
      "text:  We will cover what to look for in marketing greenwashing further on in the course. \n",
      "text:  Current challenges in elephant-based tourism\n",
      "text:  Elephant-based tourism is a consistent highlight and ‘must see’ visitor experiences when coming to Southeast Asia. But there is a perfect storm brewing between conflicting approaches, opinions about 'ethical' elephant tourism,  issues with the elephant population itself and accusations of animal cruelty. \n",
      "text:  Major issues with elephant-based tourism include:\n",
      "text:  Thousands of elephants have been born into captivity, but this has mainly occurred in Thailand where they have younger cows. Traditionally, there was a push away from captive breeding at tourism camps in other range nations. \n",
      "text:  There are several reasons for this and is mainly to do with the financial upkeep of keeping a calf. Calves have previously been viewed as a financial burden on elephant venues. They have ongoing expenses with food and supervision, while the mother cannot undertake riding or other tourism activities while she is tending to her calf for several years. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Elephant camp owners have stated that tourists will happily visit their camp without a calf onsite, so did not consider it was worth the time or effort to reproduce. Aging cows are also generally nulliparous and physically unable to reproduce. Issues can also arise between camp managers and rented elephants regarding calf ownership and financial compensation. \n",
      "text:  As mentioned earlier, there has been a prolonged and aggressive campaign against elephant ownership for many years. This has occurred from (mainly) Western organisations and associations that have different values and attitudes surrounding Asian elephants. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Many Western organisations view breeding elephants into captivity as intrinsically wrong. These groups cite a lack of environmental enrichment, poor welfare and the elephants’ ‘right’ to live in the wild. Even touching an elephant is considered inappropriate by many of these organisations.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  With a lot of donor money backing these international media campaigns, it is incredibly difficult for local communities and their voices to be heard, understood and included in the discourse.\n",
      "text:  There are undoubtably a lot of poor performers in elephant-based tourism. But in the last 20 years the sector has delivered strong reform and improvements in the way of captive elephant microchipping, greater registration to counteract illegal smuggling and the introduction of DNA passports. Despite these improvements, the sector is still plagued with a poor reputation that it is still trying to shake off. \n",
      "text:  Tour operators understand that elephant-based tourism is a massive drawcard and has the potential to be a significant income generator for their business. But public pressure means some international destination management companies are choosing not to engage (or at least advertise) in elephant tourism. Tour operators have been desperate for national guidance and support for this sector. They seek clear leadership and support from national tourism authorities.\n",
      "text:  Captive elephant management has historically been an under-researched area. Thankfully, research is now being done regarding captive elephant physiology, hormone and stress levels, training, riding, disease control and other areas of captive elephant management.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  This information is published and shared within the academic and elephant realms, but rarely seems to make an impact or change behaviours within tourism policy or animal rights groups.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  There are many peer-reviewed papers now indicating that elephant-based tourism does not have to be detrimental to an elephants’ health, safety or wellbeing. \n",
      "text:  Poor built infrastructure has been identified as a barrier to improving and increasing tourism in remote areas of Southeast Asia. Poor roads, low-quality accommodation and untrained staff at elephant camps have been flagged by some tourism operators as to why they are hesitant to send clients to areas outside of major tourism hubs.\n",
      "text:  Many of the points we have already covered, such as elephant training, smuggling and welfare, relate to animal cruelty. As this is such a critical issue for the industry to overcome, let’s explore it in more detail. \n",
      "text:  Animal cruelty\n",
      "text:  The elephant-based tourism sector continues to be plagued with claims of animal cruelty. Footage of elephants performing unnatural tricks continues to go viral and does nothing to improve sector credibility or build trust between elephant venues, tour operators and tourists. Many tourists and international non-government organisations believe elephants are being exploited and forced to perform cruel tricks for tourist dollars. \n",
      "text:  Please watch the following clip for an example of footage from Thailand in 2016. Videos such as this make the elephant-based tourism industry difficult for tour operators and tourists to openly support. \n",
      "text:  It doesn’t really matter what country these images are taken, or the how old the images are, many people are outraged by elephants suffering for tourism purposes and assume this practice is standard across the sector. In reality, animal cruelty is not indicative of the entire industry. Despite this, the result of these images on the tourism industry are: \n",
      "text:  Tour operators are under enormous pressure not to sell tickets to elephant venues. This has led to the blanket banning and boycotting of all elephant venues by some international tour operators and online travel booking sites.\n",
      "text:  Tour operators are under enormous pressure not to sell tickets to elephant venues. This has led to the blanket banning and boycotting of all elephant venues by some international tour operators and online travel booking sites.\n",

      "text:  All of the above points indicate a lack of social license for elephant-based tourism. \n",
      "text:  Social license can be defined as the level of acceptance or approval that stakeholders and communities extend to a project, site, company or industry. While technically an entirely legal sector of the tourism industry, elephant-based tourism is struggling to find its acceptability as an appropriate tourism product. Ad-hoc approaches to the industry, a lack of regulation and continual issues with alleged animal cruelty means this sector currently fails to gain support and traction in some visitor demographics.\n",
      "text:  Let’s quickly test your understanding so far:\n",
      "text:  What are some of the major issues facing the elephant-based tourism sector? Select all that apply.\n",

      "text:  A lack of strong sector regulation \n",
      "text:  Claims of widespread animal cruelty\n",
      "text:  Great! Let's see now some facts and myths about elephant-based tourism.\n",
      "text:  Elephant camp myths and realities\n",
      "text:  Managing an elephant camp is a complicated business. Managers are not hiring out motorbikes or ATVs – these are three-ton elephants that require constant care, feeding and supervision. \n",
      "text:  A good elephant venue will strive to achieve the highest standards in elephant care, wellbeing and enrichment. That is challenging enough. But perhaps the biggest hurdle facing elephant venue management is information dissemination and challenging some of the outdated stereotypes that persist with tourists and tour operators. \n",
      "text:  Let's then see some of the biggest myths and realities about elephant camp management, modified from the Asian Captive Elephant Standards Welfare FAQ. Some of these points have been mentioned already, but they are worth repeating and analysing in more detail. \n",
      "text:  Step 1\n",
      "text:  Most camps will use chains at some point (even passive viewing camps). An elephant in chains is not in itself a welfare problem. The issue is not the use of chains, but the length, time spent in chains and the positioning of the chains. \n",
      "text:  An elephant can be restrained without suffering adverse stress levels. Indeed many animals under human care face some kind of restraint, often on a daily basis and without cruelty concern (think collars, cages, leads and choker chains for dogs. Harnesses, saddles, mouthpieces and whips for horses. Cattle prods for cattle, cages for birds). \n",
      "text:  Chaining is a problem if it is prolonged, sustained and incorrectly positioned. Certification such as offered by Asian Captive Elephant Standards thoroughly assesses back-of-house chaining practices to ensure they are done with minimal effect or impact to the elephant.\n",
      "text:  Step 2\n",
      "text:  Elephants need exercise, just as humans do. Without exercise, elephants tend to become overweight and are susceptible to health issues. Walking provides both physical and mental stimulation for an elephant. In this extensive study, elephants that undertook riding had lower stress levels than a subset of elephants that did not. Walking 4-8km each day is acceptable, as long as the path is mainly shaded, the elephant is walking on is appropriate substrate (not only concrete or road), drinking water is available, it is a suitable temperature and the elephant is given adequate rest breaks.\n",
      "text:  Elephant experts agree that an Asian elephant can comfortably carry 20-25% of its body weight on its back. The saddle should be designed in a way that does not put pressure on the elephants’ spine. Two people in a well-fitted saddle weighs under 10% of an elephant’s body weight and will not cause any stress or damage.\n",
      "text:  Please see this scientific report for more information on correct elephant riding.\n",
      "text:  Step 3\n",
      "text:  The hook was developed as a guiding tool and safety measure for the mahout and is no more damaging than a rein in a horses’ mouth. The hook should be used in conjunction with verbal commands and never as a way to control the elephant. Indeed no mahout would ever expect to be able control an elephant using only the hook.\n",
      "text:  Some camps proclaim ‘no hooks’ as a way to appear welfare-friendly and to attract visitors. Sadly there has been an increase in mahout deaths at these camps, simply because the elephant may have become spooked by something out of the camp’s control (any number of loud noises or sudden movements). Nobody should die at their workplace, and everyone should have the ability to protect themselves. A mahout with a hook tucked into his pants does not make him an elephant abuser, it simply means he has a chance to survive if the worst occurs. \n",
      "text:  Similarly, some ‘no hook’ camps bypass the hook issue by making mahouts use a concealed nail in their hand. Technically it’s not a hook, so they are not fibbing! And let’s not forget ‘no hook’ does not mean ‘no abuse’. These are just a handful of reasons why the presence of hook is not in itself an admission of animal cruelty.\n",
      "text:  Step 4\n",
      "text:  Behaviours such as standing on two legs, headstands or an elephant balancing on an object are not natural. Camps should be phasing out these activities immediately and we do not recommend that these camps are patronised. \n",
      "text:  Shows should also be mindful of other externalities that may stress an elephant, including excessively loud noises and sudden movements. But crushing a coconut to show off strength or putting a wreath of flowers around a person’s neck can be achieved without any harm done to the elephant during the training process.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Step 5\n",
      "text:  Some critics believe that all human-elephant interaction is cruel, even touching an elephant. However, studies have shown that elephants are stimulated by human-elephant interaction. Training can be considered a part of an elephant's environmental enrichment. Please read this scientific report for more information.\n",
      "text:  Step 6\n",
      "text:  There are so many excellent verbal training methods now in practice at camps; fear, pain or starvation are simply not needed for training. The old stereotypes of “breaking in” elephants are very outdated and do nothing but perpetuate old stereotypes. \n",
      "text:  Elephants that have been born into captivity do not need their ‘spirits crushed’. Training a calf for 10 minutes a day using verbal commands and positive rewards is commonplace at many camps. The calves grow up knowing exactly what is expected of them, making them relaxed and not at all stressed when undertaking commands. Training has changed for the better and it’s time to acknowledge this.  \n",
      "text:  But training is still very important and is a critical component of elephant welfare at any camp. It is a fallacy that passive-viewing camps do not have to train their elephants. Appropriate training allows veterinarians the ability to provide immediate relief if an elephant is sick, without the need for stressful and invasive physical or chemical restraint.\n",
      "text:  Please note that this online training course does not endorse or actively promote elephant riding or other controversial forms of human-elephant contact. Our position is that each circumstance needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Harm minimisation and elephant welfare are paramount at all elephant venues. \n",
      "text:  Monitoring, supervising and engaging with elephant venues has a better chance of improving elephant welfare than blanket boycotts and bans, which do not improve camp standards.\n",
      "text:  It is clear that there are barriers and challenges facing the elephant-based tourism industry. Let’s quickly review these. \n",
      "text:  Images of animal cruelty and poor training make elephant tourism difficult to support. True or false?\n",
      "text:  True\n",
      "text:  False\n",
      "text:  That's correct. Instances of elephant cruelty may be rare, but the entire industry will be impacted by conflated fears. \n",
      "text:  Complete these sentences:\n",
      "text:  Great work! It is important to understand all the challenges and vulnerabilities of elephant-based tourism. In the next section, you will learn about the positives the sector brings to elephants and communities. \n",

      "text:  As we learned earlier, most captive elephants are privately owned by individuals. Some elephant owners have family connections to elephant ownership spanning generations. While the ancient art of mahoutship may be disappearing as traditional mahouts retire, there are still plenty of benefits that elephant-based tourism brings to locals. These include:\n",
      "text:  In the West it’s easy to forget that many parts of Southeast Asia remain agrarian, decentralised and are still developing. Most people still live outside of major city centres, with agriculture a mainstay for family income and survival. Elephant-based tourism in areas away from capital cities means sons and families get to remain in their community rather than being forced into cities to look for employment. Alternative income-generating activities can be scarce, and support should be given to businesses that provide ongoing employment. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Elephant camps have many other positive flow-on effects. Contracts are made between local farmers to provide plentiful, quality fodder, seasonal fruits and vegetable for elephants. Agreements between local landowners occur for use of their property for riding and exercise opportunities. This expands the benefits (and profits) of elephant-based tourism well beyond the venue’s boundaries.  \n",

      "text:  Much has been discussed about captive Asian elephants and the complexities surrounding elephant tourism. But what about the elephant owner/caretaker? It is absolutely critical to include the mahout in the discourse about elephant-based tourism. If we are not supporting the mahout, then we are not supporting the elephant.\n",
      "text:  Elephant ownership, and mahoutship, is an occupation spanning centuries. Mahoutship is poorly understood (and therefore undervalued) in Western societies, as we don’t have complementary roles in our cultures.  While it is easy to overlook the mahout and focus fully on the elephant, in reality it is the mahout that provides daily care to this endangered species. It is ultimately his role to protect this species from regional extinction. Not enough credit or recognition is given to mahouts for their hard work, dedication and the huge responsibility placed on their shoulders. \n",
      "text:  Research and studies into mahouts show some consistent values and attitudes. Most mahouts view their elephants as equal family members, as much as a son or brother. They love their elephant and strive to provide the best care and protection for them.\n",
      "text:  This point may seem frivolous, but it is really important to remember that only a very small percentage of mahouts intentionally harm their elephant. \n",

      "text:  A relationship built on trust: a mahout settles his elephant while she is microchipped.\n",
      "text:  It is important that tourism stakeholders actively listen and engage with mahouts at elephant tourism venues. Mahouts can inform tour operators about any issues raised by tourists, as well as the benefits tourism is bringing to their families and communities. In addition, a mahout that earns a good income in tourism is more likely to provide better care for his elephant. The flow-on benefits of elephant tourism are there not just the elephant camp manager, but the staff, community and the elephants. \n",

Any tourism sector is improved by receiving and implementing new findings and improved approaches. This is the foundation of best practice management. Not only does research need to be communicated effectively, but tour operators and animal groups need to receive the information, rather than ignore or downplay scientific findings. \n",

      "text:  The issues we have learned during this module clearly demonstrate the complexities and sensitivities surrounding elephant tourism and social license.  As such, most countries and companies find elephant-based tourism tricky to market and campaign, especially if there is human-elephant interaction involved. But given the immense popularity of elephant-based tourism, gaining patronage isn’t likely to be a problem. The allure of elephant tourism is a strength that industry stakeholders should respond to. It is quality assurance that is lacking and highly needed.\n",

      "text:  Ethical issues and greenwashing in elephant tourism\n",
      "text:  Greenwashing is a phrase used to describe a company purporting to be environmentally conscious for marketing purposes but, in reality, isn’t making any notable sustainability efforts. Ethical greenwashing is rife throughout the elephant-based tourism industry. The two most commonly-found examples are:\n",
      "text:  Elephant camps' names with words such as sanctuary, refuge or haven. These are very commonly depicted in elephant camp marketing as they convey a sense of peace and tranquillity for elephants.\n",
      "text:  In reality, these words are just catchphrases and cannot be considered indications of ethical elephant tourism. Excellent levels of elephant welfare can occur at venues that do not use such terms. Sanctuaries and refuges typically promote themselves using an ecocentric marketing style, in that the elephant’s rights, feelings and freedoms are the sole reason for the camp’s existence. These camps can profit heavily by using this emotive form of advertising, despite not having to provide any evidence of actual welfare or best practice standards.\n",
      "text:  \"No hook\" and \"no chain\" camps. These camps are usually marketed solely towards Western tourists, as camp owners are aware that hooks and chains are triggers for Westerners.\n",
      "text:  Initially appearing as cruelty-free environments, it is important to remember that hooks and chains are only an extremely small element of elephant care and wellbeing.  Animal cruelty can occur just as easily at camps that do not use hooks or chains. Of more concern, there have been several unnecessary mahout deaths at these camps because of the lack of personal protection equipment available to mahouts. Easily avoidable deaths should not be occurring at ethical elephant camps.\n",
      "text:  The most practical way to avoid ethical greenwashing is to implement an independent regulatory body to oversee all areas of camp management and practice.\n",

Below is an example of an ethical elephant marketing strategy, showcasing elephant-based tourism and responsible travel. This brochure is also available to download here. \n",
      "text:  Note: If you are responsible for marketing elephant-based tourism, it is inevitable that you will be asked about animal cruelty. It is important to not deny that cruelty may occur at some venues. Nobody should be forced to condone animal cruelty. \n",
      "text:  But by marketing and showcasing the well-regulated venues, you are demonstrating that you are a proponent of positive, reformative elephant tourism, not ALL elephant tourism. Focus on the positives, not the negatives. \n",
      "text:  Southeast Asia’s roadmap to COVID-19 recovery suggests that sustainable tourism and green tourism are sector priorities. Elephant-based tourism can be a perfect model of a regenerative, sustainable ecotourism product. \n",
      "text:  Let's look at some more methods to market elephant-based tourism:\n",
      "text:  Improve elephant-based tourism regulation, checks and welfare standards through the use of an independent, third-party certification scheme. Even perceived animal mistreatment is enough to dispel visitor confidence. Strong promotion and action towards working with elephant venues will provides tour operators and visitors with the confidence and reassurance that elephants living under human care are not exposed to suffering or abuse.\n",
      "text:  Highlight the cultural heritage and significance of regional Asian elephant ownership and utilisation. Promote the responsible tourism philosophy of cultural acceptance and safe elephant use in remote communities. Highlight and showcase mahout families, their knowledge and stories of elephant lore in international marketing campaigns. \n",
      "text:  Now is the time to act on endangered species protection and management. Endangered species management cannot continue to be the sole responsibility of under-resourced governments to fully fund and support. As industry leaders, we must play a role in the protection and conservation of this enigmatic species. \n",
      "text:  Tour operators and destination management companies should reconsider their outright ‘bans’ on elephant-based tourism. Bans do nothing to improve elephant welfare, nor do they deter poor elephant venues. Some destination management companies allow the individual traveller the right to choose whether they engage in human-elephant contact or not. This is respectful to both the traveller and the elephant venue and allows for respectful communication between local voices and international travellers. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Visitors should be given the opportunity to learn about the high-quality elephant venues that are in the Southeast Asian region. With the right education, a consistent message and continued support, this industry can shift to a positive and meaningful message of industry reform and resilience. \n",
      "text:  Travellers are searching online for their next adventure, and now is the time to engage and digitally promote destination experiences. Collaborate with local, national and regional tour operators and destination management companies to promote the elephant-based tourism market. \n",
      "text:  Offer interpretation and marketing promotions in multiple languages particularly Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese. Use country-specific digital tools and platforms to promote elephant tourism. \n",
      "text:  Once the tourism industry fully resumes, elephant-based tourism is predicted to be as popular as ever. Let's ensure we have a quality product ready now and for the future.\n",

      "text:  A hotel without energy is like a restaurant without food. Imagine this scenario: a guest has just checked in but has to walk up to the fifth floor with luggage as the elevators are not working. The guest enters the room and switches on the lights … but there is no lighting. The TV is not working and it is hot in the room as the air conditioning is off.\n",

      "text:  Weather patterns influence energy use at the hotel. During hot summer days, the indoor environment is kept cool and relatively dry and, during cool months, the heating is on to make it comfortable for guests and hotel staff. \n",
      "text:  Hotel energy consumption is also influenced by other factors which can be split into four main categories:\n",
      "text:    1\n",
      "text:  Size - The larger the hotel building, the more energy is needed. It is a matter of floor space that needs heating, cooling, lighting etc.\n",
      "text:  Shape - A hotel where all departments (i.e. restaurants, spa, sport facilities, guest rooms, etc.) are condensed into one building is more energy efficient than a property with many wings and separate buildings.\n",
      "text:  Age - A new hotel building is probably better insulated and uses more energy efficient technologies than an older building.\n",
      "text:  Materials - The materials used are important in terms of insulation (i.e. carpets keep warm, stones keep cool) and lighting of the building.\n",
      "text:  Technical equipment - The choice and amount of technical and electronic appliances makes a big difference in the overall hotel energy consumption.\n",
      "text:    2\n",
      "text:  Category - The more luxurious the hotel, the higher the energy needs due to the services provided (see next).\n",
      "text:  Facilities/Services - A hotel with only a few services and limited facilities (i.e. only guestrooms) consumes less energy than a hotel with multiple facilities (i.e. pool, spa, laundries, restaurants, etc.).\n",
      "text:    3\n",
      "text:  Energy Management - The hotel’s energy management policy and overall commitment by all parties (hotel staff, management team, guests) is crucial to improving energy usage.\n",
      "text:  Occupancy - This impacts energy consumption as more guests in the building means more energy needs. \n",
      "text:  However, keep in mind that some energy is always required independent of occupancy, such as HVAC (Heating/cooling, ventilation and air-conditioning), lighting of public spaces and corridors, etc.\n",
      "text:    4\n",
      "text:  Climate and weather patterns impact the use of air conditioning and heating; they are more necessary in hot and cold regions.\n",
      "text:  Local energy policies affect the energy prices and influence the type of energy used: gas, electricity, nuclear, wind, solar, hydro etc.\n",
      "text:  So, the physical parameters of hotels such as size, structure and design of the building, the age of the facility, as well as the geographical and climatic location, all impact energy consumption.\n",
      "text:  Other factors that influence a hotel’s energy consumption are operational parameters such as the number of facilities (restaurants, kitchens, in-house laundries, swimming pools and sports centres, etc.), services offered, fluctuation in occupancy levels, variations in customer preference relevant to indoor comfort, as well as culture and awareness of resource consumption among hotel staff, management and guests.\n",
      "text:  During the past decade, energy consumption in hotels increased from 25% to 30% due, not only to the growth in occupancy, but also because of new ways of living and consuming. Guests are demanding higher standards with more services and are also using more electronic devices. So, in turn, hotels have to implement more equipment to satisfy these demands. \n",
      "text:  Most studies estimate that hotels have the potential to save at least 10 - 20 % of the energy they consume. \n",
      "text:  Storytelling\n",
      "text:  20 years ago, a guest would have checked into your hotel with some paperwork at the front desk and a brass key to the room. Upon entering the room, the window would have been open to let fresh air in and the entertainment would have been the guest’s own bedside books plus the channels offered on Pay TV. The alarm clock would also have been a radio so your guest had access to music. The guest would have ordered room service via the hotel phone system and that was it. A printed guidebook informed the guest about the local attractions. \n",
      "text:  Fast forward 20 years, the guest checks in perhaps ahead of time with their smartphone and obtains a key card at the front desk (or unlocks the room with the phone). On entering the room, the keycard is slipped into the energy panel and lights, heating/cooling and Smart TV are on. The guest is impressed by the large screen size of the TV. They will then re-charge the smartphone and get the smart tablet to see what the local attractions are. They will then also charge the tablet. If it is too hot in the room, the guest will turn on the air con so the room is nice and cool. It is obvious that we need more energy than ever before.\n",
      "text:  Because of the heterogeneity of the hotel industry (so many different types of hotels, scattered across the globe in so many different regions with different climates and varying guests expectations), it is very important to find a method to model hotel energy consumption.\n",

      "text:  We will look at one particularly important factor in energy consumption changes — outdoor temperatures.\n",
      "text:  Outdoor temperatures\n",
      "text:  If you wish to compare your hotel energy performance on a year-on-year basis, you need to take into consideration seasonal weather changes. Your hotel heating and cooling requirements are proportional to the change in the average temperatures during different seasons. This process of compensating for temperature is done by factoring in the change in the total number of degree days.\n",
      "text:  You can think of a degree day as a measurement unit that is equal to a difference of one degree between the outdoor daily average temperature and the reference indoor temperature. It is then used to estimate the fuel and power requirements for heating and cooling a building.\n",
      "text:  Degree days \n",
      "text:  Degree days are an indicator of how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level, called the base. In most countries, the base is set anywhere between 16°C  and 20°C. For example, in the United States, the base is 65°Fahrenheit (18.3°C). When the temperature is above 65°F, it is assumed that hotels need to cool the facilities. Conversely, when the temperature is below 65°F, it is assumed that hotels need to heat the facilities. Experience shows that, with an outdoor air temperature of approximately 65°F (18.3°C), no heating or cooling is required.\n",
      "text:  Each degree of outside average temperature below the base is one heating degree day (HDD), and each degree above the base is one cooling degree day (CDD).\n",
      "text:  Let’s say your hotel baseline is 18°C. You know that equipment and people inside the hotel can bring the temperature up to 20 or 21°C and that’s considered to be comfortable for most people. \n",
      "text:  Day 1\n",
      "text:  You are in the middle of the autumn season and the outside air temperature for November 1st is 17°C. That means that the outside air temperature is 1 degree below the base temperature of the building (18°C).\n",
      "text:  You can work out the following formula:\n",
      "text:  1 degree x 1 day = 1 heating degree day (HDD) on November 1st\n",
      "text:  Day 2\n",
      "text:  If, on November 2nd, the outside temperature is 2 degrees below the base temperature (i.e. 16°C for a base building temperature of 18°C), you would have:\n",
      "text:  2 degrees x 1 day = 2 heating degree day (HDD) on November 2nd\n",
      "text:  Day 3\n",
      "text:  November 3rd is warmer and the outside air temperature is 18°C, the same as the base temperature (i.e. 0 degrees below the base temperature), you would have:\n",
      "text:  0 degrees x 1 day = 0 heating degree day (HDD) on November 3rd\n",
      "text:  Day 4\n",
      "text:  On November 4th, it is warmer again: 20°C. The number of degrees below the base temperature of 18°C is zero, giving:\n",
      "text:  0 degrees x 1 day = 0 heating degree day (HDD) on November 4rd\n",
      "text:  Day 5\n",
      "text:  November 5th had a temperature of 16°C from 00:00 to 12:00, and 17°C from 12:00 to 24:00. So for that day we have:\n",
      "text:  (2 degrees x 0.5 day) + (1 degree x 0.5 day) = 1.5 heating degree day (HDD) on November 5th\n",
      "text:  When the outside air temperature goes above the base temperature, you don't have any heating degree days. You will not need any heating in your hotel.\n",
      "text:  The same principle exists for Cooling Degree Days. The calculation is based on how many days and degrees the temperature surpasses your base and thus you need to cool the building.\n",
      "text:  Calculate how many HDDs altogether for the period of November 1st to November 5th\n",

      "text:  So you would expect the heating energy consumption on each of those days to vary with the heating degree days.\n",
      "text:  When you compare the heating needs on November 2nd to the heating needs on November 1st, what can you conclude?\n",
      "text:  The heating on November 2nd uses half as much energy as the heating on November 1st\n",
      "text:  The heating on November 2nd uses twice as much energy as the heating on November 1st\n",
      "text:  The heating on November 2nd is the same as the heating on November 1st\n",
      "text:  None of the above are right\n",
      "text:  You would expect the heating energy consumption on each of those days to vary according to the heating degree days.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  So, the heating on November 2nd would use twice as much energy as the heating on November 1st.\n",
      "text:  On November 3rd and November 4th the heating wouldn't use any energy at all (a zero degree day means it is warm enough and the heating does not have to be switched on).\n",
      "text:  Heating Degree Day Values \n",
      "text:   One of the best things about degree days is that you can add them together to get figures for longer periods. Adding the figures above gives a total of 4.5 heating degree days for the five days beginning on November 1st and ending on November 5th. So we'd expect that the heating system would have used 4.5 times more energy in those five days than it used on November 1st alone.\n",
      "text:  If you've got daily heating-degree-day values for each day in a month, you can add them up to get the total heating degree days for that month. If you've got the heating-degree-day values for each month in a year, you can add them up to get the total heating degree days for the whole year.\n",
      "text:  In a nutshell, you can add them up to get a total for a long period of time – an entire year – and that one total figure will represent all the relevant variations in temperature over that period.\n",

But most importantly, it will help you to verify and quantify the results of energy-saving measures allowing for weather variations. \n",

      "text:  The three tasks of digitalisation to improve energy efficiency are:\n",
      "text:  This includes technologies, such as smart meters, that gather energy consumption data within the hotel, as well as technologies that collect data related to energy use such as sensors that record light levels, temperature, etc. \n",
      "text:  Powerful computers, combined with increasingly ‘intelligent’ software algorithms, allow for the processing and analysis of data to produce insights into how energy can be used more efficiently throughout the hotel.\n",
      "text:  You can change the physical environment based on data analysis. Connected devices and equipment, such as digital room temperature controls, can optimise energy use instantly. The same can be done with connected devices such as lighting systems, heating and air-conditioning equipment and water heaters. They can be programmed to optimise energy use, depending on the time of day and occupancy levels.\n",

      "text:  Weather patterns influence energy use at the hotel. During hot summer days, the indoor environment is kept cool and relatively dry and, during cool months, the heating is on to make it comfortable for guests and hotel staff. \n",
      "text:  Hotel energy consumption is also influenced by other factors which can be split into four main categories:\n",
      "text:    1\n",
      "text:  Size - The larger the hotel building, the more energy is needed. It is a matter of floor space that needs heating, cooling, lighting etc.\n",
      "text:  Shape - A hotel where all departments (i.e. restaurants, spa, sport facilities, guest rooms, etc.) are condensed into one building is more energy efficient than a property with many wings and separate buildings.\n",
      "text:  Age - A new hotel building is probably better insulated and uses more energy efficient technologies than an older building.\n",
      "text:  Materials - The materials used are important in terms of insulation (i.e. carpets keep warm, stones keep cool) and lighting of the building.\n",
      "text:  Technical equipment - The choice and amount of technical and electronic appliances makes a big difference in the overall hotel energy consumption.\n",
      "text:    2\n",
      "text:  Category - The more luxurious the hotel, the higher the energy needs due to the services provided (see next).\n",
      "text:  Facilities/Services - A hotel with only a few services and limited facilities (i.e. only guestrooms) consumes less energy than a hotel with multiple facilities (i.e. pool, spa, laundries, restaurants, etc.).\n",
      "text:    3\n",
      "text:  Energy Management - The hotel’s energy management policy and overall commitment by all parties (hotel staff, management team, guests) is crucial to improving energy usage.\n",
      "text:  Occupancy - This impacts energy consumption as more guests in the building means more energy needs. \n",
      "text:  However, keep in mind that some energy is always required independent of occupancy, such as HVAC (Heating/cooling, ventilation and air-conditioning), lighting of public spaces and corridors, etc.\n",
      "text:    4\n",
      "text:  Climate and weather patterns impact the use of air conditioning and heating; they are more necessary in hot and cold regions.\n",
      "text:  Local energy policies affect the energy prices and influence the type of energy used: gas, electricity, nuclear, wind, solar, hydro etc.\n",
      "text:  So, the physical parameters of hotels such as size, structure and design of the building, the age of the facility, as well as the geographical and climatic location, all impact energy consumption.\n",
      "text:  Other factors that influence a hotel’s energy consumption are operational parameters such as the number of facilities (restaurants, kitchens, in-house laundries, swimming pools and sports centres, etc.), services offered, fluctuation in occupancy levels, variations in customer preference relevant to indoor comfort, as well as culture and awareness of resource consumption among hotel staff, management and guests.\n",
      "text:  During the past decade, energy consumption in hotels increased from 25% to 30% due, not only to the growth in occupancy, but also because of new ways of living and consuming. Guests are demanding higher standards with more services and are also using more electronic devices. So, in turn, hotels have to implement more equipment to satisfy these demands. \n",
      "text:  Most studies estimate that hotels have the potential to save at least 10 - 20 % of the energy they consume. \n",
      "text:  Storytelling\n",
      "text:  20 years ago, a guest would have checked into your hotel with some paperwork at the front desk and a brass key to the room. Upon entering the room, the window would have been open to let fresh air in and the entertainment would have been the guest’s own bedside books plus the channels offered on Pay TV. The alarm clock would also have been a radio so your guest had access to music. The guest would have ordered room service via the hotel phone system and that was it. A printed guidebook informed the guest about the local attractions. \n",
      "text:  Fast forward 20 years, the guest checks in perhaps ahead of time with their smartphone and obtains a key card at the front desk (or unlocks the room with the phone). On entering the room, the keycard is slipped into the energy panel and lights, heating/cooling and Smart TV are on. The guest is impressed by the large screen size of the TV. They will then re-charge the smartphone and get the smart tablet to see what the local attractions are. They will then also charge the tablet. If it is too hot in the room, the guest will turn on the air con so the room is nice and cool. It is obvious that we need more energy than ever before.\n",
      "text:  Because of the heterogeneity of the hotel industry (so many different types of hotels, scattered across the globe in so many different regions with different climates and varying guests expectations), it is very important to find a method to model hotel energy consumption.\n",

      "text:  We will look at one particularly important factor in energy consumption changes — outdoor temperatures.\n",
      "text:  Outdoor temperatures\n",
      "text:  If you wish to compare your hotel energy performance on a year-on-year basis, you need to take into consideration seasonal weather changes. Your hotel heating and cooling requirements are proportional to the change in the average temperatures during different seasons. This process of compensating for temperature is done by factoring in the change in the total number of degree days.\n",
      "text:  You can think of a degree day as a measurement unit that is equal to a difference of one degree between the outdoor daily average temperature and the reference indoor temperature. It is then used to estimate the fuel and power requirements for heating and cooling a building.\n",
      "text:  Degree days \n",
      "text:  Degree days are an indicator of how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level, called the base. In most countries, the base is set anywhere between 16°C  and 20°C. For example, in the United States, the base is 65°Fahrenheit (18.3°C). When the temperature is above 65°F, it is assumed that hotels need to cool the facilities. Conversely, when the temperature is below 65°F, it is assumed that hotels need to heat the facilities. Experience shows that, with an outdoor air temperature of approximately 65°F (18.3°C), no heating or cooling is required.\n",
      "text:  Each degree of outside average temperature below the base is one heating degree day (HDD), and each degree above the base is one cooling degree day (CDD).\n",
      "text:  Let’s say your hotel baseline is 18°C. You know that equipment and people inside the hotel can bring the temperature up to 20 or 21°C and that’s considered to be comfortable for most people. \n",
      "text:  Day 1\n",
      "text:  You are in the middle of the autumn season and the outside air temperature for November 1st is 17°C. That means that the outside air temperature is 1 degree below the base temperature of the building (18°C).\n",
      "text:  You can work out the following formula:\n",

      "text:  0 degrees x 1 day = 0 heating degree day (HDD) on November 4rd\n",
      "text:  Day 5\n",
      "text:  November 5th had a temperature of 16°C from 00:00 to 12:00, and 17°C from 12:00 to 24:00. So for that day we have:\n",
      "text:  (2 degrees x 0.5 day) + (1 degree x 0.5 day) = 1.5 heating degree day (HDD) on November 5th\n",
      "text:  When the outside air temperature goes above the base temperature, you don't have any heating degree days. You will not need any heating in your hotel.\n",
      "text:  The same principle exists for Cooling Degree Days. The calculation is based on how many days and degrees the temperature surpasses your base and thus you need to cool the building.\n",

      "text:  When you compare the heating needs on November 2nd to the heating needs on November 1st, what can you conclude?\n",
      "text:  The heating on November 2nd uses half as much energy as the heating on November 1st\n",

      "text:  Heating Degree Day Values \n",
      "text:   One of the best things about degree days is that you can add them together to get figures for longer periods. Adding the figures above gives a total of 4.5 heating degree days for the five days beginning on November 1st and ending on November 5th. So we'd expect that the heating system would have used 4.5 times more energy in those five days than it used on November 1st alone.\n",
      "text:  If you've got daily heating-degree-day values for each day in a month, you can add them up to get the total heating degree days for that month. If you've got the heating-degree-day values for each month in a year, you can add them up to get the total heating degree days for the whole year.\n",
      "text:  In a nutshell, you can add them up to get a total for a long period of time – an entire year – and that one total figure will represent all the relevant variations in temperature over that period.\n",

      "text:  So here you need to heat up 303.75 m3 of freshwater. How much energy does this require and how much does it cost? Without going into a lengthy calculation, if your fresh water is coming into the hotel at 12°Celsius and you need to heat it to 60°Celsius (to kill the legionella bacteria), you need energy to raise the water temperature by 48°Celsius. This roughly equates to 65.7 kWh of energy per m3.\n",

      "text:  To summarise\n",
      "text:  In this case, energy represents 60% of the total cost for hot showers.\n",
      "text:  Consequently, controlling consumption is essential in order to reduce utility costs. Make sure to install water conservation techniques such as low-flow shower heads and tap aerators. A showerhead of 15 litres per minute can be replaced with one of 7 litres per minute. This will cut consumption of freshwater in half and therefore the need to heat the water. \n",

In fact, your guest may be able to automatically check in via their smartphone. We live in  a technologically empowered era where digitalisation has entered every sphere of our lives and all hotel processes, including energy management.\n",
      "text:   Internet of Things (IoT)\n",
      "text:  Smart energy management basically uses the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) to manage energy use in hotels. IoT refers to everyday devices, fitted with internet capabilities, allowing them to send and receive data. These devices can also be fitted with sensors and software. This technology is interesting  for the hospitality industry because it can allow hotels to save on energy costs, while also optimising hotel rooms,  without human interference.\n",
      "text:  You may remember that energy consumption makes up 60% of a hotel’s carbon footprint. A large portion of this is to heat or cool spaces. So there are great opportunities to harness digitalisation to manage energy performance.\n",

      "text:  By retrofitting guest rooms with digital room temperature controls that are linked to the hotel’s property management system, it is possible to reduce heating or cooling costs in guest rooms.\n",

The PMS can detect when the heating is on full blast in an unoccupied room. It can also sound an alarm if the room temperature remains low despite the heating being on.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Why would such a situation happen?\n",
      "text:  Because the guests might have left the windows wide open and the heating is still on.\n",
      "text:  Because the housekeepers have not yet cleaned the room and so have not noticed that the windows are open and that the heating is on at the same time.\n",
      "text:   Because the sensor in the room is not working.\n",
      "text:  Both a) and b) are the more probable reasons.\n",
      "text:  If you work in the front office and you receive the alarm on the PMS, you would ask housekeeping to check the room immediately.  They should close the windows or turn the heating down.\n",
      "text:  In more advanced systems, the temperature can be controlled centrally. It can be adjusted without the need to physically go to the room.\n",
      "text:  Finally, if the heating and cooling system is linked to the property management system, it is possible to keep the temperature down when the room is unoccupied and then warm it up ahead of the guest’s arrival to ensure maximum comfort.\n",
      "text:  In a nutshell, digitalisation offers the potential to increase energy efficiency through technologies that gather and analyse data, then use it to make changes to the physical environment (either automatically or through human intervention).\n",
      "text:  The three tasks of digitalisation to improve energy efficiency are:\n",
      "text:  This includes technologies, such as smart meters, that gather energy consumption data within the hotel, as well as technologies that collect data related to energy use such as sensors that record light levels, temperature, etc. \n",
      "text:  Powerful computers, combined with increasingly ‘intelligent’ software algorithms, allow for the processing and analysis of data to produce insights into how energy can be used more efficiently throughout the hotel.\n",
      "text:  You can change the physical environment based on data analysis. Connected devices and equipment, such as digital room temperature controls, can optimise energy use instantly. The same can be done with connected devices such as lighting systems, heating and air-conditioning equipment and water heaters. They can be programmed to optimise energy use, depending on the time of day and occupancy levels.\n",

      "text:  If you walk around your hotel, you'll see water everywhere — your guests are splashing in the pool, drinking water with dinner and using the shower as a fresh start to their morning. And that is only the water use you can see with your own eyes — most of the water your guests are consuming is 'invisible', as it was used to produce the food and drinks they are enjoying on their holidays. \n",

      "text:  30% of the world's population lives in water-stressed areas. These can be found in regions with a lot of sunshine and little rain over the year — typical tourism destinations — for example, in northern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia.\n",
      "text:  And this is only the beginning of problematic water scarcity — UN Water predicts an increase of water use of 55 % by 2050, because more and more people will use substantial amounts of water as their living standards rise. This would mean that almost half of the world's population will live in areas with water scarcity in 2050.\n",
      "text:  Water scarcity is also connected to climate change (what isn't these days?). The impacts of climate change will make things worse as rainfall will decline and temperatures will rise, putting even more stress on an already scarce resource. \n",

      "text:  They were angry at the resort hotels for using up so much water that their own water needs were put in jeopardy. \n",

      "text:  While this is an extreme example, conflicts on water usage between tourism and locals have been reported from many parts of the world. On the other hand, tourism development brings infrastructure improvements, often leading to better accessibility to clean water for locals.  \n",
      "text:  So if your hotel is located in a water-scarce area, it is very important to also look at your water consumption from a human rights perspective. What can you do? \n",

      "text:  Use grey water for irrigation \n",
      "text:  Such systems are best installed in the building phase of a hotel or during a substantial renovation, however, converting to such a system can be a very attractive cost-saving mechanism with payback times of about 2–3 years, especially when municipal water is used for irrigation purposes. You need to make sure that the greywater recycling system complies with the legal requirements of your destination.\n",

Always operate sprinkler systems for lawns between 22:00 pm and 6:00 am in order to ensure the plants can make the most of the water before the sun evaporates it. Install a smart controller system for irrigation. \n",
      "text:  Use harvested rainwater  \n",

      "text:  Pool area\n",
      "text:  Large and creatively shaped pools are the highlight of many resort hotels. They are also the second most important direct water-consuming factor, accounting for 50 –100 litres of fresh water use per tourist and day. About half of this volume is needed during the initial filling of the pools, and half to top up evaporated water and to carry out backwashes.\n",

      "text:  Hey there! So, you have already completed lesson 1? Good job! You learnt that Vocational Education and Training worldwide applies a demand-driven approach to address the fast-changing technology and labour market. I bet you are already eager to learn how to identify training needs at your company. Let’s get started right away and familiarise ourselves with the relevant concepts for the topic!\n",
      "text:  Competency\n",
      "text:  We have already talked about the term competency in lesson 1. But let’s expand our definition a little bit by further specifying a couple of things. Our general definition of competency in the context of In-Company training is as follows:\n",
      "text:  Competency is the ability and readiness to apply the integrated knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are necessary to perform job tasks successfully in accordance with the standard of performance in the workplace. \n",
      "text:  Thus, competency is a broader concept than the ability to perform individual tasks and requires not just the possession of workplace -related knowledge and skills, but the demonstrated ability to transfer/apply them consistently over time in different work contexts. \n",
      "text:  Competency is demonstrated by action according to different required business standards in the workplace. Competency is demonstrated through the following actions: \n",
      "text:  Click on the flip cards to learn more!\n",
      "text:  Performing professional tasks\n",
      "text:  Implementing regulations of the enterprise\n",
      "text:  Responding to contingencies or incidents\n",
      "text:  Handling/addressing any further issues related to the workplace, including working with others in a consistent manner \n",
      "text:  Features of competency are that…\n",

      "text:  Competency gap\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  And then of course there is the competency gap, which we need to address with our training. We define the competency gap as follows:\n",
      "text:  The competency gap is the difference between the existing competency of the employee and the competency required to perform tasks at the workplace effectively, according to the regulations of the enterprise. \n",
      "text:  Key takeawaysThis is what you need to remember:\n",
      "text:  Needs\n",
      "text:  But because we are talking about identifying training needs, we also have to take a closer look at that term and its implications for our needs assessment process.\n",
      "text:   \n",
      "text:  Click on the tabs below to find out more!\n",
      "text:  A need is a requirement to improve current performance or to fill a gap between what is available and what is needed. Thus, a need is not a want.\n",
      "text:  Needs analysis is the systematic process of identifying and describing a need or gap between the current state and the required state. This gap must be measurable.\n",
      "text:  Needs analysis provides information to determine if training is the right and effective solution to fill a gap and to implement it. \n",
      "text:  Key message\n",
      "text:  The training needs of a company consist of planned and unexpected needs. Planned training needs are those which are foreseen and derived from the business plan.  Unexpected needs are those which cannot be foreseen, and arise due to the limited competency of the worker or technological developments, e.g. automation process, digitisation process. \n",
      "text:  Key takeawayThis is what you need to remember:\n",
      "text:  Training need is a desire to correct the competency gap between the current competency and required competency by training. \n",
      "text:  What is next?\n",
      "text:  Now we have a good idea of the basic concepts for identifying training needs. But to be able to actually perform such an analysis, there is a useful tool at our disposal, conveniently called “Training Needs Analysis”. Let’s find out more about this in the next chapter.\n",

      "text:  The learning objectives are often to supplement knowledge, or perfect skills or competencies that are lacking. Learning objectives of In-Company Training are usually determined based on the results of the Training Needs Assessment of the enterprise.\n",
      "text:  Learning content is the knowledge gaps that need to be supplemented, and parts of work that need to be done to perfect skills and capacities. This is also derived and developed from the Training Needs Assessment result. \n",
      "text:  Because the skills and ability to perform work are only formed through the actions of the learners themselves, the dominant teaching method throughout the teaching process must be action-oriented and follow a full action model.\n",
      "text:  This didactical is key for structuring the lesson plan and a little more complex to grasp. We will look at it in more in detail later on! \n",
      "text:  Now, as we have heard before, teaching covers all infrastructure (workshop, classroom) and teaching and learning media, including equipment, tools, consumable materials, and teaching aids to support teaching and learning activities. Teaching and learning media have the set following basic functions: \n",
      "text:  Note, however, that in the In-Company Training the trainer can choose and use most of the means from the enterprise's resources, such as operating procedures and safety manuals, as learning materials and use production tasks as assignments for tests and assessments. Look around your enterprise and select appropriate tools, manuals, etc., as forms of teaching and learning media. \n",
      "text:  Further considerations\n",
      "text:  In addition to the didactical elements of your training, there is more to consider in your lesson plan development. You also need to make sure that you can determine your leaners’ performance and maintain an appropriate role in the process. Let’s find out more about that!\n",

      "text:  After class, trainers are required to reflect on the lessons learnt about the clarity, accuracy, and logical order of the questions they used in the lesson.\n",
      "text:  Considerations\n",
      "text:  It can sometimes be quite challenging to come up with questions that would work in your environment. Because of this, I have some tips and considerations to help you to formulate appropriate questions for your context. Let’s check them out below! \n",
      "text:  Click on the headlines below to learn more!\n",
      "text:  The question must have accurate and clear content, be close to the purpose and requirements of the lesson, not prompting ambiguity among learners.\n",
      "text:  The questions must be close to the capabilities of learners, i.e. there must be questions for different difficulty levels. \n",
      "text:  Trainers can use many question types and forms for the same learning content and purpose.\n",
      "text:  In addition to the main questions, it is necessary to prepare additional questions and apply them depending on the learners' answers.\n",
      "text:  It is advisable to ask open questions so that learners can come up with many answer options and promote the active involvement and creativity of learners.\n",
      "text:  Conversation methods with a variety of questions are useful in teaching new lessons.\n",
      "text:  Advantages and limitations of the conversational method\n",
      "text:  When using the conversational method, the trainer acts as an organiser of the discovery journey and the learner is like a person who discovers new knowledge on their own. Therefore, after the conversation ends, learners have the joy of discovery. They both grasp new knowledge and know methods to gain that knowledge, and take one step further in their thinking level.\n",
      "text:  Key message\n",
      "text:  At the end of the conversation, the trainer needs to know how to apply the learners' opinions to conclude the resolution of the posed problem with supplementation and adjustment when necessary. By doing so, learners are more interested and confident because they see that the trainer's conclusions include their own contributions.\n",
      "text:  Leading by using the above-mentioned methods obviously takes more time than the presentation method, but the knowledge that learners acquire will be much more solid. Let’s look at the advantages and possible issues with this method below!\n",

      "text:  Sexual harassment has many faces. For example, some people might consider sexual remarks a minor issue, others might consider it to be serious sexual harassment. Virtually any sexually-oriented language, conduct or behavior can be viewed as sexual harassment if it is unwelcome.\n",
      "text:  Unwelcome Behavior are the two critical words. ‘Unwelcome’ does not necessarily mean ‘involuntary’.  A victim of sexual harassment may consent to certain conduct and actively participate in it — even if she or he considers it offensive and objectionable.\n",
      "text:  Sexual conduct is unwelcome whenever the person subjected to it considers it to be unwelcome. Whether the person welcomed a request for a date, a sex-oriented comment, or a joke depends on the circumstances. Remember, it is the impact of the conduct or behavior on the recipient (or on observers) not the intent of the harasser which determines sexual harassment.\n",

They are often clustered in three groups: natural hazards (such as strong rain, earthquakes, landslides); human-induced hazards (such as industrial accidents) and socionatural hazards (such as environmental degradation and climate change). \n",

      "text:  Extreme temperatures and droughts are caused by high pressure weather systems. Tourism is highly weather sensitive. Weather can act as an attraction and support recreational activities. For example, many people from the colder North travel to the warmer South or tropics for the warm weather. Tropical islands and other beach destinations have built an image and tourism product around sun, sea and sand and bad weather may impact the visitor experience.\n",

      "text:  Critical for tourism are extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones or floods as they may not only impact the visitor experience but pose a serious risk to people and infrastructure. These events often lead to airport closures, damages to ports and road damage or cut off therefore restricting access. In addition, cyclones, hurricanes and other strong storms can damage ecosystems such as coral reefs, rainforests or cause erosion of beaches, thus impacting the natural assets and attractiveness of destinations which may take a long time to regrow or be restored.\n",

      "text:  Large scale destruction, from langslides, subsidences or sinkholes, impacts tourism due to restricted access, loss of tourism infrastructure and assets as well as increased risk perceptions. \n",
      "text:  Volcanic eruptions often impact air transport due to large ash clouds, even if the volcano does not spit lave, reaching and impacting places far away from the actual volcano. Ash is dangerous for planes as it can accuse engine failure. On the other hand, volcanos can be major tourist attractions. \n",
      "text:  Biological hazards\n",
      "text:  The year 2020 has shown the risk of pandemics and their impact on tourism. As a global industry, tourism has not only been affected by governments responses to the pandemic (including border closures, travel restrictions, social distancing rules and many more), but have also highlighted the role tourists play in spreading the virus.\n",

      "text:  Which hazards are potentially affecting you or your business? \n",
      "text:  When identifying the hazards that are relevant to you and your business, it is important to look at each component and activity that is being carried out. \n",
      "text:  Also consider indirect impact of hazards such as road closures or other events that may limit guests accessing your property (an event may not have to happen close to your business, it could happen at visitors’ origin or an important transport hub). A loss of an important supplier may also disrupt your business. \n",
      "text:  Prioritise hazards\n",
      "text:  Based on your list of hazards and impacts, rate the likelihood of the hazard occurring and the consequence, how severe the impact would be. This determines the level of risk or risk rating. \n",
      "text:  Why rate risks? \n",
      "text:  Rating risk helps identify which hazards are most likely to occur, the hazards that cause the largest consequence shall they occur. This understanding identifies which risks to prioritise and provides the basis to make informed decisions on risk mitigation interventions.\n",

For external hazards you may be able to obtain information from government websites, industry associations or other relevant sources.

      "text:  The risk rating informs the prioritization of which hazards are addressed first. Risk which are classified as major, or extreme, should be prioritized. Alternatively, scores can be given to each level of impact and likelihood, starting with the lowest score (1), for the lowest level of impact/likelihood. To calculate the risk level, scores for impact and likelihood should be multiplied. The hazard with the highest score should be prioritized. \n",
      "text:  For example, if the hazard of a tsunami is very low (1), but the impact high (3), the risk score is 3 (1x3 = 3).\n",
      "text:  The risk score is not a robust decision-making tool, but a support tool to identify potential high-risk events that are normally not taken into account. Decisions on which risks are treated as a priority must align with stakeholders’ expectations, values and risk perceptions. \n",
      "text:  Trade-offs\n",
      "text:  Values may vary between stakeholder groups, thus, broad consultation is important. When risks are reduced, trade-offs may occur. For example, resources spent on risk reduction measures cannot be spent on other areas of the business. To address the exposure of infrastructure and people to risk, the business may decide to invest in new assets which are set back from the shoreline. To protect natural buffers such as trees, mangroves, dune vegetation or coral reefs, trade-offs between users need to be considered and addressed.\n",

Adaptation involves anticipating changes, such as changes in weather, seasons, sea level rise and even the increased intensity of extreme events. In many parts of the world, people are already living with these changes and even if we reduce emissions in line with international climate agreements tomorrow, the impacts of climate change will increase due to inertia and delays in the earth system.

      "text:  Facilities operating 24/7/365\n",
      "text:  Many hotels now consist of multiple units including restaurants, bars, clubs, entertainment facilities, spas and recreation facilities operating 24/7/365. Consequently, they have a relatively high environmental impact, which may cause strained relationships with people both locally and internationally.\n",
      "text:  Natural resources are essential to your operations\n",
      "text:  Hotel services are largely intangible, perishable and consumed as they occur. But those same services often involve the support of a wide spectrum of physical components and reliance on natural resources (think of the energy needed to power the lights, ventilation and refrigeration, or the food and clean water which are essential for your hotel operations).\n",
      "text:  Reducing inefficiencies helps reduce impacts and costs\n",
      "text:  Clearly, hotels don’t want to run the risk of shortages of any of those resources. In fact, hotel managers have the opportunity to benefit from implementing sustainability plans — from gaining efficiencies to reducing risk — thereby capturing opportunities and building resilience.\n",
      "text:  Inefficiencies lead to underperformance\n",
      "text:  One aspect that has come to light over the past decade is that hotels have a negative influence on the environment. \n",
      "text:  Pollution, waste, greenhouse gases and environmental hazards are some of the environmental outputs from hotels. The creation of waste (any type of waste — food waste, water waste, time waste, energy waste, etc.) is a sign of inefficiency. Any management school, consultant or manager will agree that inefficiencies lead to underperformance — highly undesirable in the competitive hotel market.\n",
      "text:  Sustainability is important because it means you can manage and reduce those inefficiencies and you can gain and maintain a competitive advantage while doing so.\n",
      "text:  Sustainability is a win-win-win strategy\n",
      "text:  You probably already know that gaining a competitive advantage in the hotel business is a tough job — rivalry is high and competition is fierce. Sustainability can help a hotel achieve differentiation and/or cost advantage.  Additionally, hotels have a duty to join the unprecedented mobilisation across the globe to combat climate change, restore biodiversity and support communities.\n",
      "text:  Now consider your hotel, why do you think sustainability is important? How could your hotel benefit from implementing a sustainability plan? What role can you play? Take some time to think about those questions.\n",

      "text:  You need to consider the who, how and what\n",
      "text:  Independent of the size of the hotel, from a 10-room lodge to a 500-room branded property, the success of sustainability endeavours will depend on the involvement, commitment and motivation of hotel employees and the support of management. \n",

      "text:   Generate commitment \n",
      "text:  To create momentum across the hotel, the outcome of this first meeting should be printed and displayed in each department.\n",
      "text:  To generate commitment with regards to sustainability in the hotel, establish a schedule of regular meetings. The Green Team can review the sustainability initiatives and analyse reports, feedback and comments in order to be able to detect areas for improvement, turn them into action and improve visible results. \n",

      "text:  Sustainability in the hotel means three dimensions, Environmental, Economic and Social.  Therefore the hotel’s Sustainability Management Plan should take form based on those three dimensions. However, it is a good idea to integrate two other important aspects — Quality Management and Health and Safety.\n",
      "text:  Environmental dimension\n",
      "text:  The environmental dimension focuses on an organisation’s impact on the flora and fauna that make up the ecosystem. Additionally, air, water, land use and waste enter the environmental impact equation.  The overall aim is to minimise or eliminate all practices that might adversely affect the enjoyment of the planet’s resources by present and future generations.\n",
      "text:  Economic aim \n",
      "text:  The economic aim of a traditional hotel is to make a profit. Without profit, a hotel risks going out of business, hence bankruptcy. However, many practices that contribute to mitigating environmental impacts can also provide significant short- and long-term business benefits. This is the promise of a ‘win-win’ scenario. \n",
      "text:  Social dimension\n",
      "text:  The social dimension deals with the impact an organisation has on the communities in which it operates, also in terms of employment practices. The main consideration of the social dimension is for the hotel to positively contribute to the lives of local people now and in the future. \n",
      "text:  Quality management\n",
      "text:  In terms of quality management, it is imperative that hotels keep in mind the needs of guests and employees when making decisions. Any decisions made on the sustainability front should support the wellbeing of everyone in the hotel. \n",
      "text:  Health and safety\n",
      "text:  Lastly, health and safety is of utmost importance for hotels to ensure confidence and trust by guests and employees alike. Here too, sustainability should go hand in hand with health and safety measures.\n",

      "text:  Now you may ask yourself — what is the difference between policies, procedures, standards and guidelines? \n",
      "text:  A policy is a formal statement of a principle that must be followed. For example, a policy on health and safety addresses the relevance of safety for the hotel and to whom the principle applies, such as guests and employees. \n",
      "text:  A procedure on the other hand provides the steps the hotel must follow to achieve a task and comply with the policy. For example, restaurant tables are to be disinfected prior to guests taking a seat is a step based on the health, sanitation and safety policy. So it flows from the policy.\n",
      "text:  A procedure may become a standard once it is accepted as a uniform procedure applicable in all cases and across various properties. In this case, the standard may be to use a specific sanitiser for the restaurant tables and let it sit on the table top for at least 2 minutes before wiping it clean.\n",
      "text:  Finally, a guideline provides general guidance or some additional advice and supports the policies, standards and procedures.\n",

      "text:  The use of energy in hotels greatly impacts the atmosphere the hotel wishes to create, but it is invisible to hotel guests who believe they have a seemingly unlimited supply of energy. Energy is used everywhere in hotels — for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in the guest rooms, kitchens, laundry, pool, lifts and escalators and so on.  Of all commercial buildings, hotels are among the highest energy users per square metre.\n",
      "text:  Generally speaking, commercial buildings are, on average, 40% more energy-intensive compared to residential buildings. And looking at commercial buildings, hotels are among the largest users of energy. For example, a warehouse may consume about 90 kWh/m2 (kilowatt-hour per square meter), a retail mall approximately 200 kWh/m2 while a hotel may average 300 to 500 kWh/m2 and a food service facility up to 600 kWh/m2, due to the refrigeration equipment.\n",
      "text:  So, why should you manage energy consumption at the hotel?\n",
      "text:  First and foremost, you must make sure that you have enough energy to support all the services, functions and processes at the hotel. Guests expect the hotel to provide these services and energy is required for guest and employee comfort (i.e. making sure the property is cooled down, warmed up or lit accordingly). \n",

      "text:  Lobbies and foyers are usually busy with people moving around while guest rooms and restaurants are spaces where occupants tend to be less mobile. However, the temperature should be kept within a range of 20° and 23°C.\n",
      "text:  Step 2\n",
      "text:  You need to understand, operate and maintain the hotel's energy-consuming equipment and systems in an energy-efficient manner. This also includes being careful to purchase new hotel equipment that consumes less energy.\n",
      "text:  Step 3\n",
      "text:  Energy settings in the hotel should be adjusted according to the time of day, day of the week, season, occupancy and weather for greater energy efficiency and cost savings.\n",
      "text:  Step 4\n",
      "text:  You need to develop and use performance criteria for each department, which includes setting targets and monitoring results. For example, it has become a standard in hotels to use kilowatt-hour per square metre of space as a key indicator.\n",
      "text:  Step 5\n",
      "text:  New technologies often present opportunities for energy saving.  You should regularly assess whether new technologies can help create efficiencies within your own hotel operation.\n",
      "text:  Step 6\n",
      "text:  Every hotel goes through a predetermined cycle of refurbishment.

      "text:  Encourage everyone to put forward ideas and proposals on how to reduce water consumption.\n",
      "text:  Step 7\n",
      "text:  An important component of your action plan is regular monitoring of your progress.\n",
      "text:  This includes quantitative monitoring (e.g. keeping track of water usage via meter readings, water costs,  etc) and qualitative monitoring (e.g. employees’ involvement, motivation level, etc). \n",
      "text:  Additionally, by monitoring at regular intervals, unexpected changes in consumption (e.g. due to pipe leaks) can be detected rapidly and corrective action taken.\n",
      "text:  Step 8\n",
      "text:  You may need to establish new standard operating procedures based on the feedback received.\n",
      "text:  For example, you can achieve immediate water savings through changes in routine (such as not washing food items under running water) and thus you can establish a new SOP.\n",
      "text:  Step 9\n",
      "text:  Once you have developed your new standard operating procedures, make sure you continue to stimulate motivation by giving feedback to staff. \n",
      "text:  Think about rewarding success (e.g. water champion of the month)\n",
      "text:  Step 10\n",
      "text:  Finally, join forces with other hotels and provide mentoring to help them reduce their water consumption.\n",
      "text:  Tactics to manage water usage\n",
      "text:  A small leak from a cold water tap (e.g. a small coffee cup per minute) may seem insignificant but, over a whole day, nearly a cubic metre of water will be wasted, incurring costs for freshwater and sewer charges.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  If it is a hot water tap, the cost could be doubled based on the energy required to heat the water.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Repairing a leaky tap can be as simple as replacing a washer. Regular maintenance always pays.\n",
      "text:  Conventional twist taps use around 4 litres per hand wash although it is also not uncommon to find a standard flow of 2.2. gallons per minute (over 8 litres per minute). Water-efficient fixtures can reduce this to 2 litres or less. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Further reductions can be achieved by using tap aerators. These spray devices create fine water jets that incorporate air and reduce water flow. Flow-controllers or low-flow fixtures can be installed in areas where water pressure is less important.\n",
      "text:  Conventional flush toilets are responsible for up to 40 per cent of domestic water use. Putting a displacement device or a tank restrictor in the cistern will reduce the cistern capacity but a more efficient solution is to fit a low-flush toilet (known as High-Efficiency Toilets or HET)  that uses less than 4 litres of water per flush.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Guests at a resort type hotel often spend a large portion of their day at the hotel resulting in 4 to 6 flushes/day/guest. Therefore the water consumption from toilets is significant.\n",
      "text:  Dry composting toilets and urinals are the most water-efficient toilets on the market as they use no water at all. They use biological processes for the disposal and processing of human excrement into organic compost material. Waste is transported to a composting chamber below the toilet by gravity.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  There are also commercial micro-flush systems that use a small amount of water, usually about 0.5 litres per use. They all work on the same principle: no unpleasant smell and minimal exposure to unprocessed material. \n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Hotels that operate laundries on the premises have several options to reduce water consumption. The first is to use front loading machines that consume less water and less detergent than top loading models. \n",
      "text:  \n",

      "We are here................\n",
      "text:  Facilities operating 24/7/365\n",
      "text:  Many hotels now consist of multiple units including restaurants, bars, clubs, entertainment facilities, spas and recreation facilities operating 24/7/365. Consequently, they have a relatively high environmental impact, which may cause strained relationships with people both locally and internationally.\n",
      "text:  Natural resources are essential to your operations\n",
      "text:  Hotel services are largely intangible, perishable and consumed as they occur. But those same services often involve the support of a wide spectrum of physical components and reliance on natural resources (think of the energy needed to power the lights, ventilation and refrigeration, or the food and clean water which are essential for your hotel operations).\n",
      "text:  Reducing inefficiencies helps reduce impacts and costs\n",
      "text:  Clearly, hotels don’t want to run the risk of shortages of any of those resources. In fact, hotel managers have the opportunity to benefit from implementing sustainability plans — from gaining efficiencies to reducing risk — thereby capturing opportunities and building resilience.\n",
      "text:  Inefficiencies lead to underperformance\n",
      "text:  One aspect that has come to light over the past decade is that hotels have a negative influence on the environment. \n",
      "text:  Pollution, waste, greenhouse gases and environmental hazards are some of the environmental outputs from hotels. The creation of waste (any type of waste — food waste, water waste, time waste, energy waste, etc.) is a sign of inefficiency. Any management school, consultant or manager will agree that inefficiencies lead to underperformance — highly undesirable in the competitive hotel market.\n",
      "text:  Sustainability is important because it means you can manage and reduce those inefficiencies and you can gain and maintain a competitive advantage while doing so.\n",
      "text:  Sustainability is a win-win-win strategy\n",
      "text:  You probably already know that gaining a competitive advantage in the hotel business is a tough job — rivalry is high and competition is fierce. Sustainability can help a hotel achieve differentiation and/or cost advantage.  Additionally, hotels have a duty to join the unprecedented mobilisation across the globe to combat climate change, restore biodiversity and support communities.\n",
      "text:  Now consider your hotel, why do you think sustainability is important? How could your hotel benefit from implementing a sustainability plan? What role can you play? Take some time to think about those questions.\n",

      "text:  Sustainability in the hotel means three dimensions, Environmental, Economic and Social.  Therefore the hotel’s Sustainability Management Plan should take form based on those three dimensions. However, it is a good idea to integrate two other important aspects — Quality Management and Health and Safety.\n",

      "text:  The environmental dimension focuses on an organisation’s impact on the flora and fauna that make up the ecosystem. Additionally, air, water, land use and waste enter the environmental impact equation.  The overall aim is to minimise or eliminate all practices that might adversely affect the enjoyment of the planet’s resources by present and future generations.\n",
      "text:  Economic aim \n",
      "text:  The economic aim of a traditional hotel is to make a profit. Without profit, a hotel risks going out of business, hence bankruptcy. However, many practices that contribute to mitigating environmental impacts can also provide significant short- and long-term business benefits. This is the promise of a ‘win-win’ scenario. \n",
      "text:  Social dimension\n",
      "text:  The social dimension deals with the impact an organisation has on the communities in which it operates, also in terms of employment practices. The main consideration of the social dimension is for the hotel to positively contribute to the lives of local people now and in the future. \n",
      "text:  Quality management\n",

      "text:  A policy is a formal statement of a principle that must be followed. For example, a policy on health and safety addresses the relevance of safety for the hotel and to whom the principle applies, such as guests and employees. \n",
      "text:  A procedure on the other hand provides the steps the hotel must follow to achieve a task and comply with the policy. For example, restaurant tables are to be disinfected prior to guests taking a seat is a step based on the health, sanitation and safety policy. So it flows from the policy.\n",
      "text:  A procedure may become a standard once it is accepted as a uniform procedure applicable in all cases and across various properties. In this case, the standard may be to use a specific sanitiser for the restaurant tables and let it sit on the table top for at least 2 minutes before wiping it clean.\n",

This is partly due to the fact that it offers significant cost savings in the short term and thus is attractive to hotels. But increasingly, you will also find policies on food waste and water management as well as commitment towards reduction or banning of single-use plastics.

      "text:  The use of energy in hotels greatly impacts the atmosphere the hotel wishes to create, but it is invisible to hotel guests who believe they have a seemingly unlimited supply of energy. Energy is used everywhere in hotels — for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in the guest rooms, kitchens, laundry, pool, lifts and escalators and so on.  Of all commercial buildings, hotels are among the highest energy users per square metre.\n",
      "text:  Generally speaking, commercial buildings are, on average, 40% more energy-intensive compared to residential buildings. And looking at commercial buildings, hotels are among the largest users of energy. For example, a warehouse may consume about 90 kWh/m2 (kilowatt-hour per square meter), a retail mall approximately 200 kWh/m2 while a hotel may average 300 to 500 kWh/m2 and a food service facility up to 600 kWh/m2, due to the refrigeration equipment.\n",
      "text:  So, why should you manage energy consumption at the hotel?\n",
      "text:  First and foremost, you must make sure that you have enough energy to support all the services, functions and processes at the hotel. Guests expect the hotel to provide these services and energy is required for guest and employee comfort (i.e. making sure the property is cooled down, warmed up or lit accordingly). \n",

Energy is used everywhere in hotels — for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in the guest rooms, kitchens, laundry, pool, lifts and escalators and so on.  Of all commercial buildings, hotels are among the highest energy users per square metre.\n",
      "text:  Generally speaking, commercial buildings are, on average, 40% more energy-intensive compared to residential buildings. And looking at commercial buildings, hotels are among the largest users of energy. For example, a warehouse may consume about 90 kWh/m2 (kilowatt-hour per square meter), a retail mall approximately 200 kWh/m2 while a hotel may average 300 to 500 kWh/m2 and a food service facility up to 600 kWh/m2, due to the refrigeration equipment.\n",

      "text:  Further reductions can be achieved by using tap aerators. These spray devices create fine water jets that incorporate air and reduce water flow. Flow-controllers or low-flow fixtures can be installed in areas where water pressure is less important.\n",
      "text:  Conventional flush toilets are responsible for up to 40 per cent of domestic water use. Putting a displacement device or a tank restrictor in the cistern will reduce the cistern capacity but a more efficient solution is to fit a low-flush toilet (known as High-Efficiency Toilets or HET)  that uses less than 4 litres of water per flush.\n",

      "text:  Guests at a resort type hotel often spend a large portion of their day at the hotel resulting in 4 to 6 flushes/day/guest. Therefore the water consumption from toilets is significant.\n",
      "text:  Dry composting toilets and urinals are the most water-efficient toilets on the market as they use no water at all. They use biological processes for the disposal and processing of human excrement into organic compost material. Waste is transported to a composting chamber below the toilet by gravity.\n",

      "text:  There is also a cost associated with food waste. For example, the UK’s Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP) revealed that the hospitality and food sector serves over 8 billion meals annually with an associated 2.87 million tons of food and packaging waste.\n",
      "text:  When looking at the total cost of food waste, one must think not only of the food purchase itself but also the labour, the energy required to store and prepare the food and so on.\n",
      "text:  Food purchases and labour costs involved make up the largest part of food waste — almost 90%.\n",
      "text:  A complete breakdown of the total cost of food waste, showing the principal cost drivers, can be seen here: \n",

      "text:  This means fewer intermediaries and suppliers that can deliver and promote their local goods. Since the goods only travel a short distance, producers and consumers can actually talk to each other. Your hotel is therefore working with local producers and promoting local foods.\n",
      "text:  Short supply chains are also known as local supply chains. A short supply chain benefits the three pillars of sustainability:\n",
      "text:  Short supply chains boost the local economy by increasing local sales and demand for regional products.  This, in turn, can increase farmers’ income and have a positive effect on local employment.\n",
      "text:  Short supply chains have many social benefits. Most notably, it supports the development of social interaction and trust between producers and hoteliers. It also enhances the sense of community and increases visitors’ knowledge of concepts related to food, agriculture and the environment.\n",
      "text:  Creating a local supply chain helps mitigate environmental impacts. In particular, short supply chains can have a significant positive impact on the environment in terms of reduction in carbon emissions linked to transport. \n",
      "text:  Additionally, a local supply chain can contribute to the reduction or even elimination of pesticides. If organic agriculture practices are actively supported they, in turn, lead to a reduction in soil and water pollution and soil quality degradation.\n",

      "text:   Sustainable food is better for our planet, the environment, the animals and people. Can you imagine why? \n",
      "text:  Let’s do a quick quiz to find out.\n",
      "text:  Which of the following statement is FALSE about sustainable food\n",
      "text:  Sustainable food emits less greenhouse gas emissions\n",
      "text:  It is cheaper\n",
      "text:  It needs less water                                                                  \n",

      "text:  It supports local culture and fair working conditions\n",
      "text:  All are true except that it is not cheaper.  But there are good reasons why we do it...\n",
      "text:  Better carbon footprint\n",
      "text:  The way vegetables and fruits are cultivated has a significant impact on the carbon footprint. Each type of cultivation (e.g. in heated greenhouse, organically or conventionally, during the season, off-season, regional or international) emits more or less carbon emissions. \n",
      "text:  Let’s have a look at tomatoes and their carbon emissions related to the type of cultivation:1 kilogram of tomatoes grown organically, regionally and in the season (the best and most sustainable option) emits 0.035 kg of carbon emissionsWhereas1 kilogram of tomatoes grown conventionally in a heated greenhouse, off-season emits 9.3 kg of carbon emissions. This is mostly because of the heating energy greenhouses demand.\n",
      "text:  Generally speaking, the production of animal-based products tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than the production of plant-based food.\n",
      "text:  Less water needed\n",
      "text:  The production of food needs water to irrigate plants, sustain and feed animals, packaging etc. The amount depends on the type of food and the production. The production of fruits and vegetables needs less water than the production of dairy or meat products.\n",
      "text:  For example, to produce one kilo of apples, 700 litres of water are needed, whereas the production of 1 kilo of beef needs 15,500 litres of water.\n",
      "text:  Sustainable food also means safe food with high nutritional value. Grown locally and organically, the food does not only taste better but it normally contains more vitamins and minerals as it was not transported from far away and was not treated with pesticides. The same goes for food that is served fresh and was not frozen or highly processed.\n",
      "text:  Unsustainable farming has negative impact on the worms and soil micro-organisms that play a critical part in maintaining soil fertility as well as on bees as pollinators for agricultural crops.\n",
      "text:  \n",
      "text:  Sustainable farming practices avoid growing monocultures and using pesticides and other chemicals that are harmful to soil and animals. Instead, they enhance a variety of crops, using water and other natural resources responsibly and are creating habitats for pollinators and beneficial insects.\n",
      "text:  Sustainable food is not only about the food itself or the protection of the environment. It is also about fair working conditions for all involved.\n",
      "text:  For example, sustainable food promotes fair wages for workers and fair income for farmers, a healthy and safe working environment and fair working hours. \n",

      "text:  Stages of sustainable food\n",
      "text:  Not every stage can directly be influenced by tourist business. But they can influence the way sustainable food is purchased, prepared, presented and consumed. These are influenced by generic tasks such as waste management, working conditions for staff or engagement with society which apply to multiple stages.\n",
      "text:  Holistic view of food production\n",
      "text:  It is important for tourism businesses such as hotels to maintain a holistic view of food production and to look at the relationships between the phases. This means you should assess the sustainable balance of the food on offer. For example, a product can have a high degree of sustainability when purchased, but creates a lot of food waste when prepared. This can be prevented by this system-level perspective.\n",
      "text:  Have you decided to buy local instead of importing the vegetables and fruits?\n",
      "text:  In conclusion\n",
      "text:  As a result of buying locally, you will receive higher quality vegetables and fruits that are fresher and tastier. You will also reduce your carbon emissions from transport. You might even save money as local products are often cheaper because transport costs are less. Plus, you support the local value chain and everyone is happy.\n",

      "text:  Presentation of food specialities\n",
      "text:  A Cretan corner in the restaurant where Cretan specialities were presented. Employees could suggest their ancestor’s best recipes and the chefs cooked them using local products.\n",
      "text:  Souvenirs\n",

With the support of a company, their food waste was measured with an online waste-analysis tool. The food waste was measured for at least 2 weeks after breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It was divided into food waste from storage, production, overproduction and plate leftovers.

The results showed that the implemented measures were successful as the amount of food waste was reduced significantly (see the data below from one of the hotels).\n",

This is mostly because of the heating energy greenhouses demand.\n",

      "text:  Sustainable food also means safe food with high nutritional value. Grown locally and organically, the food does not only taste better but it normally contains more vitamins and minerals as it was not transported from far away and was not treated with pesticides. The same goes for food that is served fresh and was not frozen or highly processed.\n",

Instead, they enhance a variety of crops, using water and other natural resources responsibly and are creating habitats for pollinators and beneficial insects.\n",

      "text:  In the framework of a project, six hotels on the island of Rhodes worked to reduce their food waste. With the support of a company, their food waste was measured with an online waste-analysis tool. The food waste was measured for at least 2 weeks after breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It was divided into food waste from storage, production, overproduction and plate leftovers. All measurements were recorded on a sheet.\n",

      "text:  In order to reduce the amount of food waste from overproduction, it was agreed to offer more live cooking, to minimise the food variety and to adapt the dishes according to the guests’ nationalities.\n",
      "text:  After the implementation of several small measures with little investment needed, the hotels measured the amount of food waste again. The results showed that the implemented measures were successful as the amount of food waste was reduced significantly (see the data below from one of the hotels).\n",

Let’s take into consideration what this means financially — they were able to reduce their costs by more than 26,000 Euros over one year — simply by measuring the food waste and implementing appropriate and practical measures.\n",

      "text:  This lecture will consider AI’s potential for the justice system in India by exploring both the opportunities and risks in adopting AI for civil and criminal litigation, as well as law enforcement. \n",
      "text:  To contextualize the needs of the judiciary and the uses of AI in India, Russia, China, Mexico, USA, Abu Dhabi and Argentina are discussed to illustrate the ways in which AI is being adopted in justice systems. \n",
      "text:  Proponents argue that the use of AI will lead to transparent, impartial judicial outcomes by eliminating subjective bias. \n",
      "text:  However, overreliance on AI, without human intervention, may lead us to a paradoxical situation where in the quest for equality, AI-generated judicial outcomes may overlook the very factors that cause gender, religious, cast and class discrimination in India. \n",

To develop a responsibility matrix, the following aspects need to be identified: all tasks required for a project or daily operations, the skills required to complete these tasks successfully as well as the skills of each team member. The responsibilities to complete the tasks are subsequently assigned to existing roles while taking into account existing skills and experiences of the team members. \n",

A common way to analyse stakeholders is through stakeholder mapping. There are different approaches and types of maps. \n",

      "text:  A common approach is to plot all stakeholders against two variables: their interest in the business (low to high) and their influence on (or power to influence) the success of the business (low to high). This creates four quadrants. For resilience building in particular, the second variable may rate the stakeholder’s influence on responding to change or disasters, or their influence on building resilience. \n",

Innovation can be developing a new way to deliver a service (e.g. through interaction with guests), changing processes (e.g. using resources more efficient or reducing waste), changing organisational structures or changing marketing strategies (applying a value-based approach).

      "text:  Having detailed emergency response plans is important in order to prepare a coordinated response in the event of a crisis. There may be different emergency response plans for different types of events and they need to include goals and objectives such as protecting people from hazards, including staff, guests, contractors and other relevant stakeholders; minimizing business disruptions, preventing environmental pollution minimizing damage to assets and facilities and protecting the organisation’s image or brand. It is important to include clear roles and responsibilities in the plans (who does what) and to update them regularly. Ideally, trainings and exercises should be conducted regularly.\n",
      "text:  While emergency response plans set out details how the organization responds to a crisis, it is important that a degree of flexibility is maintained to allow for swift decision making at the operational level. \n",

      "text:  Detailed information on the required resources are needed, including both internal and external resources.  These may involve people, facilities, equipment, communications and information technology, materials, supply, financial resources, expertise. Identifying resource requirements may involve a needs assessment which can be mapped against existing resources. Resource management includes a logistics component as it needs to consider not only what resources are required, but also how they can be accessed during crisis.\n",
      "text:  The development of emergency response plans commences with a risk assessment (module 3), to identify potential emergency situations. \n",
      "text:  Step 1\n",
      "text:  The primary objective and first priority of the emergency response should be to protect lives and people present at the property, including staff, guests, suppliers, contractors and others. Second priority should be to stabilize the incident. \n",
      "text:  Step 2\n",
      "text:  Emergency procedures include evacuations (in event of fire for example), sheltering/shelter-in-place (for example from storm events or chemical clouds), or lockdown (when faced with violence for example), but also first aid or containment of chemical spills. The plan needs to identify the most appropriate action for each hazard. Local emergency services may provide localized information, maps, kits or guides that support this process. \n",
      "text:  Step 3\n",
      "text:  Site and facility plans need to form part of the plan as well, as external emergency services have limited knowledge of your premises. Site information should also include details of equipment stored, locations of controls for building management, utility or protection systems and instructions how to operate emergency equipment or systems.\n",
      "text:  Step 4\n",
      "text:  Get in touch with your local emergency services to confirm the information they recommend to be included in your plan and provide them with a copy. Other relevant management or security services should also receive a copy.\n",
      "text:  Crisis communication\n",
      "text:  Cisis communication includes developing and implementing crisis communication plans and strategies, including communication protocols.  It is critical to have a plan in place that outlines who communicates what and when, including how people will be warned of a hazard and who alerts first responders such as emergency services, internal fire warden or the responsible person. Having a communication plan in place allows the business to communicate the relevant information promptly and accurately with  each stakeholder group. \n",
      "text:  At times of a crisis, there may not be time to craft messages carefully. Therefore, the plan may involve pre scripted messages that can easily be adjusted according to the incident. The plan also details what communication channels are used for distribution and who is responsible. \n",

Like any other disaster response plan, the IT plan should be tested on a regular basis.\n",
      "text:  Employee assistance\n",
      "text:  A crisis may not only impact the business but employees and their families, either due to loss of work, injury, or in case of larger disasters, due to impacts to the wider community. These impacts may affect the psychological state of a person and thus impact the ability to work effectively (e.g. as decision making may be compromised). This may have wider consequences for the business itself. \n",
      "text:  The emergency response plan should therefore include information how the business can support affected employees. This includes communication with employees, and may also include employee assistant schemes, where employees have access to counseling services to deal with the emotional impact of a disaster.\n",

Furthermore, a reduced workforce can lead to increased workload and strain on remaining staff and consequently, a reduction in productivity. \n",

Another example is the popular use of home robots in the north. This is not common in the south due to lack of affordability as well as many dwellings do not have electricity.\n",
